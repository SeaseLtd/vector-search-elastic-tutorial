The presence of communication amid scientific minds was equally important to the success of the Manhattan Project as scientific intellect was. The only cloud hanging over the impressive achievement of the atomic researchers and engineers is what their success truly meant; hundreds of thousands of innocent lives obliterated.
The Manhattan Project and its atomic bomb helped bring an end to World War II. Its legacy of peaceful uses of atomic energy continues to have an impact on history and science.
Essay on The Manhattan Project - The Manhattan Project The Manhattan Project was to see if making an atomic bomb possible. The success of this project would forever change the world forever making it known that something this powerful can be manmade.
The Manhattan Project was the name for a project conducted during World War II, to develop the first atomic bomb. It refers specifically to the period of the project from 194 â¦ 2-1946 under the control of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the administration of General Leslie R. Groves.

Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs. The Army component of the project was designated the

Tutorial: Introduction to Restorative Justice. Restorative justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour. It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practices and programs reflecting restorative purposes will respond to crime by: 1  identifying and taking steps to repair harm, 2  involving all stakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in responding to crime.
Organize volunteer community panels, boards, or committees that meet with the offender to discuss the incident and offender obligation to repair the harm to victims and community members. Facilitate the process of apologies to victims and communities. Invite local victim advocates to provide ongoing victim-awareness training for probation staff.
The purpose of this paper is to point out a number of unresolved issues in the criminal justice system, present the underlying principles of restorative justice, and then to review the growing amount of empirical data on victim-offender mediation.
Each of these types of communitiesâthe geographic community of the victim, offender, or crime; the community of care; and civil societyâmay be injured by crime in different ways and degrees, but all will be affected in common ways as well: The sense of safety and confidence of their members is threatened, order within the community is threatened, and (depending on the kind of crime) common values of the community are challenged and perhaps eroded.
The approach is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community, rather than the State. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender has shown the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.
Inherent in many peopleâs understanding of the notion of ADR is the existence of a dispute between identifiable parties. Criminal justice, however, is not usually conceptualised as a dispute between victim and offender, but is instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. This raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a âdisputeâ.
Criminal justice, however, is not usually conceptualised as a dispute between victim and offender, but is instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state. 3 This raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a âdisputeâ.
The circle includes a wide range of participants including not only the offender and the victim but also friends and families, community members, and justice system representatives. The primary distinction between conferencing and circles is that circles do not focus exclusively on the offense and do not limit their solutions to repairing the harm between the victim and the offender.
Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
Phloem and xylem are complex tissues that perform transportation of food and water in a plant. They are the vascular tissues of the plant and together form vascular bundles. They work together as a unit to bring about effective transportation of food, nutrients, minerals and water.

Phloem is a conductive (or vascular) tissue found in plants. Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
Unlike xylem (which is composed primarily of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport sap. The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in sugars made by the photosynthetic areas.
In xylem vessels water travels by bulk flow rather than cell diffusion. In phloem, concentration of organic substance inside a phloem cell (e.g., leaf) creates a diffusion gradient by which water flows into cells and phloem sap moves from source of organic substance to sugar sinks by turgor pressure.
The mechanism by which sugars are transported through the phloem, from sources to sinks, is called pressure flow. At the sources (usually the leaves), sugar molecules are moved into the sieve elements (phloem cells) through active transport.
Phloem carries the products of photosynthesis (sucrose and glucose) from the leaves to other parts of the plant. â¦ The corresponding system that circulates water and minerals from the roots is called the xylem.
Xylem transports water and soluble mineral nutrients from roots to various parts of the plant. It is responsible for replacing water lost through transpiration and photosynthesis. Phloem translocates sugars made by photosynthetic areas of plants to storage organs like roots, tubers or bulbs.
At this time the Industrial Workers of the World had a membership of over 100,000 members. In 1913 William Haywood replaced Vincent Saint John as secretary-treasurer of the Industrial Workers of the World. By this time, the IWW had 100,000 members.
This was not true of the Industrial Workers of the World and as a result many of its members were first and second generation immigrants. Several immigrants such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, Carlo Tresca, Arturo Giovannitti and Joe Haaglund Hill became leaders of the organization.
Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 1850s, Chinese workers migrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take agricultural jobs, and factory work, especially in the garment industry.
The Rise of Industrial America, 1877-1900. When in 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner entitled their co-authored novel The Gilded Age, they gave the late nineteenth century its popular name. The term reflected the combination of outward wealth and dazzle with inner corruption and poverty.
American objections to Chinese immigration took many forms, and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions, as well as ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese laborers who came to the United States did so in order to send money back to China to support their families there.
The rise of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period. Few Americans at the end of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of American industry.
The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States to restrict, but not completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.
Industrial Workers of the World. In 1905 representatives of 43 groups who opposed the policies of American Federation of Labour, formed the radical labour organisation, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The IWW's goal was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class.
The railroads powered the industrial economy. They consumed the majority of iron and steel produced in the United States before 1890. As late as 1882, steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production in the United States. They were the nationâs largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal.
This finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China.

Colorâurine can be a variety of colors, most often shades of yellow, from very pale or colorless to very dark or amber. Unusual or abnormal urine colors can be the result of a disease process, several medications (e.g., multivitamins can turn urine bright yellow), or the result of eating certain foods.
I had 3 cups of coffee and a red bull today all in 4 hours. The first time I urinated, it was an amber color. Then I got worried and drank a lot of water and now my urine is back to normal (light yellow). This only happened once after drinking all that caffeine.

During the visual examination of the urine, the laboratorian observes the urine's color and clarity. These can be signs of what substances may be present in the urine. They are interpreted in conjunction with results obtained during the chemical and microscopic examinations to confirm what substances are present.
But the basic details of your urine -- color, smell, and how often you go -- can give you a hint about whatâs going on inside your body. Pee is your bodyâs liquid waste, mainly made of water, salt, and chemicals called urea and uric acid. Your kidneys make it when they filter toxins and other bad stuff from your blood.
However, red-colored urine can also occur when blood is present in the urine and can be an indicator of disease or damage to some part of the urinary system. Another example is yellow-brown or greenish-brown urine that may be a sign of bilirubin in the urine (see The Chemical Examination section).
The shade, light or dark, also changes. If it has no color at all, that may be because youâve been drinking a lot of water or taking a drug called a diuretic, which helps your body get rid of fluid. Very dark honey- or brown-colored urine could be a sign that youâre dehydrated and need to get more fluids right away.
A good rule of thumb is the darker your urine, the more water you need to drink. And if your urine is any other color besides a various shade of yellow (which weâll get into down below) something may be wrong.
Color, density, and smell can reveal health problems. Human urine has been a useful tool of diagnosis since the earliest days of medicine.

Primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, is a chronic, or long-term, disease of the liver that slowly destroys the medium-sized bile ducts within the liver. Bile is a digestive liquid that is made in the liver. It travels through the bile ducts to the small intestine, where it helps digest fats and fatty vitamins.In patients with PBC, the bile ducts are destroyed by inflammation. This causes bile to remain in the liver, where gradual injury damages liver cells and causes cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver.As cirrhosis progresses and the amount of scar tissue in the liver increases, the liver loses its ability to function.t travels through the bile ducts to the small intestine, where it helps digest fats and fatty vitamins.

However, a major motive with people today wanting to use the barley harvest to determine the start of the year is to justify starting the year AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE, frequently even before the end of winter. That is in fact the opposite of what the Talmud records the leaders of the Sanhedrin occasionally doing ...
Some people claim that the timing of the barley harvest in Israel should be the deciding factor as to when to start the new year for determining the observance of God's annual Feasts and Holy Days.
Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain. It was one of the first cultivated grains and is now grown widely. Barley grain is a staple in Tibetan cuisine and was eaten widely by peasants in Medieval Europe. Barley has also been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods.
The state of the barley harvest could PERHAPS cause the start of a year to be postponed to THE FOLLOWING NEW MOON (thereby giving the previous year a 13th month), but the state of the barley harvest could NEVER DETERMINE THAT AN EARLIER NEW MOON SHOULD BE USED TO START THE YEAR!
The grape harvest was usually completed before Tabernacles, but most of the olive harvest came after the autumn festivals. In ancient Israel the primary harvest season extended from April to November. This harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three major crops: the spring grain harvest, the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest.
Barley is not as cold tolerant as the winter wheats (Triticum aestivum), fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter triticale (Ã Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but may be sown as a winter crop in warmer areas of Australia and Great Britain. Barley has a short growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant.
âWheat ripens later than barley and, according to the Gezer Manual, was harvested during the sixth agricultural season, yrh qsr wkl (end of April to end of May)â (page 88; also see the chart on page 37 of Borowskiâs book, reproduced below).
That claim is obviously not correct. God did not hinge the start of a new year on the state of the barley crop, even if on occasions in the first and second centuries A.D. the pharisaical leaders of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem decided to use the state of the barley harvest to start a new year one new moon later.
Barley is always sown in the autumn, after the early rains, and the barley harvest, which for any given locality precedes the wheat harvest (Exodus 9:31 f), begins near Jericho in April--or even March--but in the hill country of Palestine is not concluded until the end of May or beginning of June.
Pentecost, near the end of the grain harvest, included grain and loaf offerings (verses 16-17). Pentecost was also called âthe Feast of Harvestâ (Exodus 23:16). Barley and wheat were planted in the autumn and ripened in spring. Barley matured faster and would be harvested sooner. The firstfruits of grain offered during the Festival of Unleavened Bread would have been barley.
There are however some very serious illnesses that can cause this pain in left side under ribs. These would include pneumothorax, pancreatitis, and dissection of the abdominal aorta. It could also be a spleen disorder, kidney stones, or pericardritis (inflammation of the heart sac).
Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas and can be caused by eating very fatty foods. If the left side pain under ribs is caused by a dissection of the abdominal aorta, your life is in immediate danger. Dying from an internal hemorrhage is the major risk involved in this situation.
What organs are on your left side of body. Causes of Pain under Left Rib Cage. Here are just some of the possible reasons why you may be feeling pain under your left rib cage: Gas Stuck in the Colon â There is a chance that you have gas stuck in your colon. The amount of gas that is stuck may be excessive.
For the individual bones, see Rib. For ribs of animals as food, see Ribs (food). For other uses, see Rib (disambiguation). The rib cage is an arrangement of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral column, ribs, and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs.
If the lower set of ribs on the right side of the rib cage get damaged due to an injury, then one is likely to experience a sharp pain under the right rib cage. If the pain worsens when one tries to bend or twist the body, then an X-ray examination should be conducted to study the extent of damage to the ribs.
Vital organs such as heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage. Under the rib cage lie many organs that form a part of the abdomen. Most of the organs that lie in the abdominal region are a part of the digestive system. These include the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, stomach, small intestine and the large intestine.
The only organs contained in the chest cavity are the lungs and the heart. Obviously, one of the lungs is under the left rib cage, and then the heart is also found here. The oâ¦nly other part of the chest cavity to be noted would be the diaphragm, which aids a person's breathing. 4 people found this useful.
Usually, you can feel the pain reverberating from the upper portion of the left side of your abdomen towards the left side of your ribcage. Irritation on the Spleen â There is a chance that your spleen has already ruptured because of various reasons and this can cause some pains on the left rib cage.
Each rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft, and they are numbered from top to bottom. The head of rib is the end part closest to the spine with which it articulates. It is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface which is divided by a horizontal crest into two facets.
With either of these there is a fairly simple medication treatment. There is also the possibility that gas is caught in the colon. This is even less serious that acid reflux and does not require medication to resolve it. Sharp pain left side under ribs might come from a condition called costochondritis.

(1841-1904). A 19th-century Bohemian composer, Antonin Dvorak was noted for adapting traditional folk music into opera, symphony, and piano pieces. The From the New World symphony, his best-known work, is thought to be based partly on the spirituals of African American slaves.
Dvorak Quick Facts: 1  Johannes Brahms once wrote a letter praising and exalting Dvorakâs music; they later became great friends. 2  After moving to America in 1892, Dvorak spent his summer vacation in the small town of Spillville, Iowa in 1893, because of itâs mainly Czech population.
The region is home to the village of Nelahozeves, where the composerâs grandparents lived from the year 1818. Antonin Dvorak (in full Antonin Leopold Dvorak) was born here on 8 September 1841 to Anna and Frantisek Dvorak, as the first of nine children. The family ran a business in house number 12, a cottage that had an inn on the ground floor.

No Social Security COLA for senior citizens in 2016 seems certain as do Medicare hikes. Means problems for Medicare: Part B premiums cannot increase for most , so minority has to bear burden of rising costs - Oct. 8, 2015.
Typical expenses continue to outpace annual benefit hikes. Social Security benefits are likely to increase by 1.7% in 2015, slightly more than this year's 1.5% increase but still well below average increases over the past few decades, according to an unofficial projection by the Senior Citizens League.
Obviously, the fact that Social Security benefits didn't rise from a cost of living adjustment in 2016 was bad news for retirees who rely on their monthly checks for a big part of their overall income.
Oct. 15, 2015 â Here is what the Social Security Administration has to say about the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) next year for senior citizens and others in the program: âWith consumer prices down over the past year, monthly Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for nearly 65 million Americans will not automatically ...

The trustees also projected that Medicare's Hospital Insurance trust fund will run out of money earlier than previously predicted.
The earnings limit for people turning 66 in 2016 will stay at $41,880. (We deduct $1 from benefits for each $3 earned over $41,880 until the month the worker turns age 66.) There is no limit on earnings for workers who are full retirement age or older for the entire year.

Swinging Flashlight Test: Swing a light back and forth in front of the two pupils and compare the reaction to stimulation in both eyes. When light reaches a pupil there should be a normal direct and consensual response.
Pupillary reflex. In medicine, there are two pupillary reflexes 1  -. The pupillary light reflex is the reduction of pupil size in response to light. 2  The pupillary accommodation reflex is the reduction of pupil size in response to an object coming close to the eye.
1 The pupillary light reflex is the reduction of pupil size in response to light. 2  The pupillary accommodation reflex is the reduction of pupil size in response to an object coming close to the eye.
normal pupillary reflex response. Pupils equal and responsive , is a common phrase used in various emergency or hospital television series. The pupil should respond by getting smaller caused by the contraction of the constrictor muscles in the iris.
An RAPD is a defect in the direct response. It is due to damage in optic nerve or severe retinal disease. It is important to be able to differentiate whether a patient is complaining of decreased vision from an ocular problem such as cataract or from a defect of the optic nerve.
abnormal pupillary reflex means. If this doesn't happen, it could mean that either the retina or optic nerve is damaged, or the visceromotor output pathway from the oculomotor nerve is not working. This type of response indicates ipsilateral issues.
The physiology behind a normal pupillary constriction is a balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Parasympathetic innervation leads to pupillary constriction. A circular muscle called the sphincter pupillae accomplishes this task. The fibers of the sphincter pupillae encompass the pupil.
1. These are the pupillary reflexes mediated through the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system; 2. the ciliospinal reflex which tests pupillary responses mediated through the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, and 3. the salivary reflex which is also parasympathetic.
1 Swing a light back and forth in front of the two pupils and compare the reaction to stimulation in both eyes. 2  When light reaches a pupil there should be a normal direct and consensual response.
1 When performing a pupillary exam, it sometimes helps to illuminate pupils indirectly from the side, so you can actually see what is happening. 2  Observe the pupil size and shape at rest, looking for anisocoria (one pupil larger than the other). 3  Observe the direct response (constriction of the illuminated pupil).

Oral Phase. The first phase of swallowing is the oral phase which involves the tongue, mandible, lips, cheeks and palate all working together to ensure the food is adequately prepared for the future stages. In this phase, food is mixed with saliva and chewed with the aid of the muscles of mastication.
Swallowing is a complex act that involves the coordinated activity of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and esophagus (Figure 1). A swallow has four phases: oral preparatory, oral propulsive, pharyngeal and esophageal.3.
Stages of the Swallow. (Logemann, 1983, 1989,1997; Cherney, 1994) The oral preparatory phase. This part of the swallow is voluntary. It is a mechanical phase that can be by-passed by dropping liquid or food into the back of the throat. In this stage, the food is chewed into smaller pieces and tasted.
-purpose: to move food from the front of the oral cavity to the anterior faucial arches, where the reflexive swallow is initiated. -Less than one second in duration. -Bolus passes posteriorly in the oral cavity to the faucial pillars. -CNs V, VII, IX, X, XI and XII.
Article Sections. Swallowing disorders are common, especially in the elderly, and may cause dehydration, weight loss, aspiration pneumonia and airway obstruction. These disorders may affect the oral preparatory, oral propulsive, pharyngeal and/or esophageal phases of swallowing.
Dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing, is not a disease in itself but a condition that can be brought on by many different causes because swallowing is a delicate process, easily disturbed. Some causes are minor and quickly treatable; others are serious, even life-threatening.
The coupling of the findings of diminished tongue sensory and motor function with increasing age might contribute to the increased prevalence of dysphagia, aspiration and pneumonia seen in the elderly (12, 13). In healthy individuals, the oral phase of swallowing is generally completed in approximately 1 second (14).
The process of swallowing is known as deglutition. The act of swallowing can be divided into three stages for easy understanding. 1. Oral stage: This is the only voluntary stage in the act of swallowing. It consists of: Mastication of food making it into a bolus fit to be swallowed. The main muscles involved in the act of chewing are: a. Masseter.
(5) neuromuscular components of swallowing. 1)Lip closure to hold the bolus in the mouth anteriorly (keeps food from spilling) 2)Tension in the labial and buccal musculature to close the anterior and lateral sulci. 3)Rotary jaw (circular) motion for mastication/grinding.
By Dr. Jonathan Aviv. The purpose of swallowing is to safely transport food from the mouth to the stomach. A myriad of diseases and conditions affect this basic purpose. Therefore, understanding the normal swallow is one of the keys to beginning to develop a therapeutic plan for the patient with impaired deglutition.

The scale of public works in the Mississippian culture can be estimated from the largest of the earthworks, Monks Mound, in the Cahokia Mounds near Collinsville, Illinois, which is approximately 1,000 feet (300 metres) long, 700 feet (200 m) wide, and 100 feet (30 metres) high.
Mississippian Period. 1  A specific complex adaptation to linear, environmentally circumscribed floodplain habitat zones. 2  Pottery tempered with crushed mussel shell - an important innovation since it allowed potters to enhance the qualities of their clays and thus build more durable and larger vessels in a wider range of forms.
How Were Mounds Made? Imagine groups of workers toiling from dawn to dusk, gathering baskets of dirt. They carry their burdens to a clearing, dump the soil, and tamp it down with their feet.
âIndian moundâ is the common name for a variety of solid structures erected by some of the indigenous peoples of the United States. Most Native American tribes did not build mounds. The majority were constructed in the Lower Southeast, Ohio River Valley, Tennessee River Valley and the Mississippi River Valley. Some types of shell mounds can be found along the entire length of the United Statesâ Atlantic Coast.
Mississippian people in eastern Arkansas were using mounds when Spanish explorers arrived in 1541, and the Caddo in the Red River valley were still using mounds during the winter of 1691â92, when explorers from Mexico visited them.
Mound Builders, in North American archaeology, name given to those people who built mounds in a large area from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Mississippi River to the Appalachian Mts. The greatest concentrations of mounds are found in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys.
MOUND BUILDERS. Mound Builders were prehistoric American Indians, named for their practice of burying their dead in large mounds. Beginning about three thousand years ago, they built extensive earthworks from the Great Lakes down through the Mississippi River Valley and into the Gulf of Mexico region.
They spent hundreds of years building huge, steep platforms made of hard packed dirt - mounds. Many of the mounds were built in geometric patterns. Some were very long and wide - 1,000 feet long and over 700 feet wide. If you think of it as a football field - these huge mounds would cover over 3 football fields long and over 2 football fields wide!
Note: The Kolomoki Site in southern Georgia appears to be a transitional site from Woodland Indians to Moundbuilders and is not included in the list. The most intact Mississippian Cultural site in the East is the Etowah Indian Mounds State Historic Site. The site was recognized as a De Soto Trail Site by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1989 and is an anchor site on northwest Georgia's Chieftains Trail and is located in Bartow County, Georgia.
When European first arrived in North America, the peoples of the Mississippian culture were still using and building platform mounds. Documented uses for Mississippian platform mounds include semi-public chief's house platforms, public temple platforms, mortuary platforms, charnel house platforms, earth lodge/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms.

Physical properties of matter include odor, color, density, solubility, boiling point. and melting point, and its physical state at room temperature. A colorless, odorless liquid that. freezes at 0Â°C and boils at 100Â°C is probably water, for example. Every substance also has. chemical properties.
A photon is massless, has no electric charge, and is a stable particle. A photon has two possible polarization states. In the momentum representation of the photon, which is preferred in quantum field theory, a photon is described by its wave vector, which determines its wavelength Î» and its direction of propagation.
THE FOUR TYPES OF EVIDENCE. There are four traditional types of evidence: real, demonstrative, documentary, and testimonial. Some rules of evidence apply to all four types and some apply only to some or one of them. First, we will cover general rules of admissibility that apply to all evidence. Then, we will cover foundational rules that relate to specific kinds of evidence. Finally, we will cover some special topics, like the form of examination, the hearsay rule, and the lay opinion rule, that frequently cause problems in the courtroom.
For example, the pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.
The evolution of a gas, a color change, the formation of a precipitate, and the. evolution of heat are frequently telltale signs that a chemical reaction has occurred. You will examine some substances and describe their physical properties in this lab. You. will cause changes in some of these substances. You will decide whether the changes are. physical or chemical using test and making observations. You also will demonstrate that mass is. conserved in physical and chemical changes.
A photon is an elementary particle, the quantum of all forms of electromagnetic radiation including light. It is the force carrier for electromagnetic force, even when static via virtual photons.
) There is a sequence of steps to initiate upon arriving at an incident or crime scene to __.
The energy of a system that emits a photon is decreased by the energy E {\displaystyle E} of the photon as measured in the rest frame of the emitting system, which may result in a reduction in mass in the amount E / c 2 {\displaystyle {E}/{c^{2}}} .
Our task would be impossible but for two important facts. First, all of you have studied the law of evidence before, either in a course on evidence or in preparation for the bar exam. Accordingly, most of the rules presented will already be familiar to you.
In physics, a photon is usually denoted by the symbol Î³ (the Greek letter gamma). This symbol for the photon probably derives from gamma rays, which were discovered in 1900 by Paul Villard, named by Ernest Rutherford in 1903, and shown to be a form of electromagnetic radiation in 1914 by Rutherford and Edward Andrade.
The most common way of taking Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds for hallucinogenic effects is by either chewing the seeds or grinding them and steeping with hot water. User experiences vary from life altering mystical journeys to a slow motion train wreck. A positive user experience, from Erowid (2),
Tramadol (Ultram) can affect a chemical in the brain called serotonin. Hawaiian baby woodrose can also affect serotonin. Taking Hawaiian baby woodrose along with tramadol (Ultram) might cause too much serotonin in the brain and side effects including confusion, shivering, stiff muscles, and other side effects.
Hawaiian baby woodrose increases a chemical in the brain called serotonin. Meperidine (Demerol) can also increase serotonin in the brain. Taking Hawaiian baby woodrose along with meperidine (Demerol) might cause too much serotonin in the brain and serious side effects including heart problems, shivering, and anxiety.

Hawaiian baby woodrose is an ornamental plant that is related to the morning glory plant. It grows in Florida, California, and Hawaii. The seeds are used to make medicine. Despite serious safety concerns, Hawaiian baby woodrose is used for pain relief and causing sweating.
Some H.B.Woodrose seeds may not even be hallucinogenic or contain enough LSA to have an effect. âPreceding unsigned comment added by 88.18.198.51 (talk) 22:31, 31 August 2007 (UTC) There is next to no referencing of anything on this page, regardless of the accuracy of the material.
[Untitled] The main body of the plant also contains small amounts of strychnine[citation needed], a potent toxin, but its presence is negligible in the seeds.. I've done an exaustive search on this plant for 15 years, and have over 100 journal articles on morning glory species alone.
Taking Hawaiian baby woodrose with these medications used for depression might cause there to be too much serotonin. This could cause serious side effects including heart problems, shivering, and anxiety. Some of these medications used for depression include phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), and others.
HAWAIIAN BABY WOODROSE Side Effects & Safety. Hawaiian baby woodrose is UNSAFE. It can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hallucinations, blurred vision, dilated pupils, rapid movement of eyeballs, sweating, fast heart rate, and increased blood pressure.
The alkaloid ergine, also known as d-lysergic acid amide (LSA), is present in Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, along with many other alkaloids. Total alkaloid content in the seeds is about 1%, with ergine and its isomer constituting about 50% of that (1).
John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes, CB (5 June 1883 â 21 April 1946) was a British economist. His ideas, called Keynesian economics, had a big impact on modern economic and political theory. His ideas also had a big impact on many governments' tax and economic policies.
Keynes argued that governments should solve problems in the short run rather than wait for market forces to fix things over the long run, because, as he wrote, âIn the long run, we are all dead.â This does not mean that Keynesians advocate adjusting policies every few months to keep the economy at full employment.
Keynesian economists are rectifying that omission by integrating the real and financial sectors of the economy.â . Sarwat Jahan is an Economist and Chris Papageorgiou is a Deputy Division Chief in the IMFâs Strategy, Policy, and Review Department.
Keynes argued that inadequate overall demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. An economyâs output of goods and services is the sum of four components: consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports (the difference between what a country sells to and buys from foreign countries).
John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes, CB, FBA (/ËkeÉªnz/ KAYNZ; 5 June 1883 â 21 April 1946), was a British economist whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of modern macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments.
British economist John Maynard Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking that overturned the then-prevailing idea that free markets would automatically provide full employmentâthat is, that everyone who wanted a job would have one as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands (see box).
John Maynard Keynes was born at 7 Melville Road, Cambridge, England. His father was John Neville Keynes, an economics lecturer at Cambridge University. His mother was Florence Ada Brown, a successful author and a social reformer. His younger brother, Geoffrey Keynes (1887â1982) was a surgeon and bibliophile (book lover).
Subsequently, the term âKeynesian economicsâ was used to refer to the concept that optimal economic performance could be achieved â and economic slumps prevented â by influencing aggregate demand through activist stabilization and economic intervention policies by the government.
Keynesian economics gets its name, theories, and principles from British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883â1946), who is regarded as the founder of modern macroeconomics. His most famous work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.
DEFINITION of 'Keynesian Economics'. An economic theory of total spending in the economy and its effects on output and inflation. Keynesian economics was developed by the British economist John Maynard Keynes during the 1930s in an attempt to understand the Great Depression. Keynes advocated increased government expenditures and lower taxes to stimulate demand and pull the global economy out of the Depression.
2011 â The first of its kind in North America, EdgeWalk is the worldâs highest full circle hands-free walk on a 5 ft (1.5 m) wide ledge encircling the top of the CN Towerâs main pod, 356m, (1168 ft, 116 stories) above the ground.
With its microwave receptors at 338 m (1,109 ft.) and at the 553.33m (1,815 ft., 5 inches) antenna, the CN Tower swiftly solved the communications problems with room to spare and as a result, people living in the Toronto area now enjoy some of the clearest reception in North America.

Each year, over 1.5 million people visit Canadaâs National Tower to take in the breathtaking views and enjoy all the CN Tower has to offer. After 40 months of construction, the CN Tower was opened to the public on June 26, 1976 and it was well on its way to becoming the countryâs most celebrated landmark.
Defining the Toronto skyline at 553.33m (1,815ft5in), the CN Tower is Canadaâs most recognizable and celebrated icon. The CN Tower is an internationally renowned architectural triumph, an engineering Wonder of the Modern World, world-class entertainment and dining destination and a must see for anyone visiting Toronto.
You would be hard pushed to name a building that has defined Toronto more than the CN Tower. Love it or loathe it, the massive concrete structure has dominated the city's skyline and provided a visual reference point for outsiders for almost a generation. The tower itself is something of an oddity.

In total 687 men, including the five Sullivan brothers, were killed in action as a result of its sinking.he was down 12 ft (4 m) by the bow, but able to maintain 13 kn (15 mph, 24 km/h). A few minutes after 1100, two torpedoes were launched from I-26. These were intended for San Francisco, but both passed ahead of her. One struck Juneau in the same place that had been hit during the battle.
Juneau Basics. Juneau, the capital of Alaska and the second largest city in the state, is located on the Gastineau Channel, less than 100 miles from the US-Canadian border.

Using contractors and subcontractors. The difference between contractors and subcontractors. There is an important distinction between using contractors and subcontractors. Contractors. Contractors provide agreed services to a client for a set fee - and possibly duration - under a contract for services.
A subcontractor is a person who is hired by a general contractor (or prime contractor, or main contractor) to perform a specific task as part of the overall project and is normally paid for services provided to the project by the originating general contractor.
A subcontractor agreement is an agreement which specifies the terms of a relationship between a contractor and subcontractor, including the type of work the subcontractor is being hired to perform.
(sabkÉnËtrÓktÉ) , ((American) sabËkontraktÉr) noun. a person who undertakes work for a contractor and is therefore not directly employed by the person who wants such work done. The building contractor has employed several subcontractors to build the block of flats.
With this approach, each subcontractor is assigned an expected claim level or claim experience target based on its loss history, for claim categories that have a credible volume of information for actuarial projections.
Subcontractors are frequently hired to work on construction sites. A subcontractor agreement specifies the terms of a relationship between a contractor and subcontractor, including the type of work the subcontractor is being hired to perform. Electricians may work as subcontractors on a construction project.
There is an important distinction between using contractors and subcontractors. Contractors provide agreed services to a client for a set fee - and possibly duration - under a contract for services. (This is in contrast to a contract of service, eg a contract of employment, which is between an employee and employer.)
For the class of mathematical functions, see Subcontraction map. A subcontractor is an individual or in many cases a business that signs a contract to perform part or all of the obligations of another's contract.
A subcontractor has a contract with the contractor for the services provided - an employee of the contractor cannot also be a subcontractor. Subcontractors undertake work that a contractor cannot do but for which the contractor is responsible.
Related Terms. Junior or secondary contractor who contracts with a prime contractor (and not the principal or owner of the project) to perform some or all of the prime contractor's contractual-obligations under the prime contract. You Also Might Like... Jeffrey Glen.

the dust bowl was caused partially by the great depression, due to the depression, farmers were trying to make maximum profit, so they cut down trees to get more land, planted too much, and let cattle graze too much, and that took out all the roots holding the soil together, causing the soil to loosen into dust and blow everywhere.

What were the two basic causes of the Dust Bowl during the early 1930s? strip mining and toxic chemical dumping over farming and drought urban sprawl and - 333667 1
Drought Conditions. While not a direct cause of the Great Depression, the drought that occurred in the Mississippi Valley in 1930 was of such proportions that many could not even pay their taxes or other debts and had to sell their farms for no profit to themselves. The area was nicknamed The Dust Bowl..
2016-01-15T12:11:18-05:00. Assuming that this is referring to the same list of options that was posted before with this question, the correct response would be applying dryland farming techniques to agriculture, since a lack of such measures was in fact a major source of the devastation. Report.
What were the two basic causes of the Dust Bowl during the early 1930s? strip mining and toxic chemical dumping over farming and drought urban sprawl and overpopulation deforestation and railway construction
What?! There is no Declaration of Independence?! What if... Select two of the grievances from the list in the lesson below: No trials by jury Not able to trade freely Unfair taxes ...
2015-03-09T21:42:19-04:00. Severe drought and failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion were the reasons for the Dust Bowl. So the correct answer would be toxic chemical dumping over farms and drought urban sprawl. Report.
http://www.enotes.com/history/q-and-a/what-were-causes-dust-bowl-1930s-35681 Well, the Great Depression of the 1930s was one of the main factors that caused the Dust Bowl of the same period but it was not the MAIN CONTRIBUTING factor that lead to the ecological disaster.

Rarotongan (MÄori KÅ«ki 'Äirani) Rarotongan or Cook Islands Maori is an Polynesian language spoken on the island of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. It's closely related to Taihitian and Maori. Some sources classify Rarotongan as a dialect of Cook Islands Maori (MÄori KÅ«ki 'Äirani). Other Cook Islands Maori dialects are Rakahanga-Manihiki; Tongareva dialect (Penrhyn); Ngaputoru dialects of Atiu, Mitiaro and Mauke; Aitutaki; and Mangaia.

Water going from a gas to a liquid: Condensation. Water going from a gas to a solid: Deposition. In each phase change there will be either an absorption or release of latent heat. Latent heat absorption cools the surrounding air while latent heat release warms the surrounding air.
The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from. a solid to a liquid. a liquid to a solid. a gas to a solid. a solid to a gas. The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from. a liquid to a gas. a liquid to a solid. a gas to a solid. a solid to a liquid. When a gas is compressed it changes state into a. liquid.
American Chemical Society 3. Welcome. Free online resource for teaching. basic concepts in chemistry at the. middle school level. Six chapters of activity-based lesson. plans which align with state standards. in physical science and inquiry. Two main goals: â¢ Help students understand common. every day observations on the. molecular level. â¢ Help students design and conduct.
The term sublimation refers to a physical change of state and is not used to describe transformation of a solid to a gas in a chemical reaction. For example, the dissociation on heating of solid ammonium chloride into hydrogen chloride and ammonia is not sublimation but a chemical reaction.
Sublimation (phase transition) Sublimation is the phase transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas phase without passing through the intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation is an endothermic process that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram.
Boiling Evaporation and Condensation. Evaporation is the change of phase from liquid to gas. Evaporation occurs only at the surface of the water and at every temperature. However, evaporation is directly proportional to the temperature, increasing in the temperature increasing in the rate of evaporation.
Sublimation is the change of state from solid to gas. Some of the solid matters change their states directly to the gas with the gained heat. For example, dry ice (frozen CO2) sublimate when heat is given. Inverse of this process is called deposition, in which gas matters lost heat and change their phase to solid.
CHANGE OF STATE. Evaporation, condensation, sublimation, freezing, and melting are changes of state. Evaporation is the changing of liquid water to invisible water vapor. Condensation is the reverse process. Sublimation is the changing of ice directly to water vapor, or water vapor to ice, bypassing the liquid state in each process. Snow or ice crystals result from the sublimation of water vapor directly to the solid state. We are all familiar with freezing and melting processes.
Introduce the process of condensation. If students do not know what the process of condensation is, you can tell them it is the opposite of evaporation. In evaporation, a liquid (like water) changes state to become a gas (water vapor). In condensation, a gas (like water vapor) changes state to become a liquid (water). Explain that as water molecules in the air cool and slow down, their attractions overcome their speed and they join together, forming liquid water. This is the process of condensation.
hai friend, from your points, melting, boiling and sublimation are the process done when heat taken in for transition of state of matter from solid to liquid, liquid to gas and solid to gas respectively, also evaporation comes in this section. Condensation and freezing are done when heat gone out. best regards.

The Koepka Genealogy and Family Tree Page. Welcome to the Koepka Family page at Surname Finder, a service of Genealogy Today. Our editors have compiled this checklist of genealogical resources, combining links to commercial databases along with user-contributed information and web sites for the Koepka surname.
Brooks Koepka (born May 3, 1990) is an American professional golfer. He is ranked inside the top-25 in the Official World Golf Ranking and chose a different route than other young Americans to get mainstay status on the PGA Tour, by starting his career on the European Challenge Tour and eventually the European Tour.
Last name: Born. This ancient name is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and is one of the earliest topographical surnames existing today. The derivation is from the Old English pre 7th Century burna, burne, spring, stream, which was originally used as a topographic name for someone who lived beside a stream.
Many things can go wrong when a record collection is indexed. If you're having diffculty finding Koepka ancestors in a particular database at one site, try finding it on another and compare the results.
In the North, however, the word burn is still used for a stream. Some instances of the modern surname, found as Bown(e), Burn(e), Burns, Born(e), Boorne, Burner and Bo(u)rner, may be locational in origin, from a place named from being beside a stream.
DNA testing for genealogy continues to improve. If you had some of your Koepka relatives tested several years ago, it may be worthwhile to have them retested. Likewise, as DNA testing companies have gathered more results and samples, you may be able to find more matches if you search again with your test results.

Nike athlete Brooks Koepka carved out a 1-under-par 34-35=69 in the final round of the Travelers Championship to post 10-under 270, down three into a two-way T9, four back of champion Russell Knox. The 26-year-old began the finale on 9-under (T6), six back of overnight leader Daniel Berger.
As additional sources for vital records, original documents, vintage photographs and surname-based DNA projects are discovered, this page is updated to offer the best list for researching Koepka ancestry.
Early years and amateur career[edit] Koepka was born in West Palm Beach, Florida but raised in Lake Worth, Florida. He attended Cardinal Newman High School. He played college golf at Florida State University where he won three events and was a three-time All-American. He qualified for the 2012 U.S. Open while still an amateur, but missed the cut.
A symphony is a large, multi-movement work for orchestra. It calls for instruments from all four sections (winds, strings, percussion, and brass) and explores a complete range of melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, and timbre. That seems like a basic definition, but even that already has a number of exceptions.
So we generally have either Fast-Slow-Fast-Fast or Fast-Fast-Slow-Fast. There are also different types of Key-schemes through the symphony. A good example of a classical key-scheme would be the 1st, 3rd and 4th movements are in the tonic key, but the 2nd movement and the trio of the 3rd movement are in the subdominant.
Some composers, including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Carl Nielsen, continued to write in the traditional four-movement form, while other composers took different approaches: Jean Sibelius' Symphony No. 7, his last, is in one movement, whereas Alan Hovhaness's Symphony No. 9, Saint Vartanâoriginally op. 80, changed to op. 180âcomposed in 1949â50, is in twenty-four.
A symphony is divided into four movements; the first movement is usually fast, the second one is slow, the third is medium, and the fourth movement is fast. This pace is intended to keep the listener...
Lastly, the finale introduces a percussion group that is meant to be (and in the S.F. Symphony performances actually was) under the stage. It is the ticking clock on individual existence and it plays in a different tempo from the rest of the orchestra.
Sonata Form. Sonata form is used in many types of large-scale instrumental works of the late 18th century and the 19th century, including: Symphonies, which are technically Sonatas for Orchestra. Most Concertos are written in a modified 3-movement Sonata form, excluding the Minuet/Scherzo movement.
An orchestra (/ËÉËrkáµ»strÉ/ or US: /ËÉËrËkÉstrÉ/; Italian: ) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which mixes instruments from different families, including bowed string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, each grouped in sections.
Indeed, after Schumann's last symphony, the Rhenish composed in 1850, for two decades the Lisztian symphonic poem appeared to have displaced the symphony as the leading form of large-scale instrumental music.
Believe it or not, there is a way to understand Beethoven's genius past the first eight notes. As you'll soon discover, a symphony is a form of classical music. Form is the arrangement of sections within a piece of music, and understanding how these sections work together can help the listener make sense of what the composer was trying to express.
1 Symphonic composition during the mature Classical period (roughly the late 18th to the early 19th century) was overwhelmingly dominated by Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven.
The word convict here (elegcw /elegxo) means to bring to light or expose error often with the idea of reproving or rebuking. It brings about knowledge of believing or doing something wrong, but it does not mean that the person will respond properly to that knowledge. Our usage of the English word, convict, is similar.
The first problem is the meaning of anothen: is it âagainâ or âfrom aboveâ? The occurrence of this same word in 3:31 with the unquestioned meaning âfrom aboveâ quickly tilts the evidence in that direction. It also has that meaning in 19:11, 23.
The word translated âcomfortâ by the NASU translators was parakaleo (an AAS3S). It was translated as âcomfortâ by the NASU (and NASB), KJV, NKJV, YLT (Youngâs Literal Translation), and the BBE (Bible in Basic English) and âencourageâ by the NET, NIV, NLT, ESV, NJB (New Jerusalem Bible), NRSV, and the RSV.
In 16:9, the problematic elegxo occurs: âin every instance the verb has to do with showing someone his sin, usually as a summons to repentanceâ (Carson, John, 537). Therefore, to convict the world is shaming it and attempting to persuade it of its guiltiness, and in this way âcalling it to repentanceâ (ibid.).
However, Louw & Nida include Luke 8:41 under 33.315: âto ask a person to accept offered hospitality â âto invite.ââ But parakaleo does not mean invite here, but simply to urge, implore, or even beg someone to do something.
The Ministry of the Holy Spirit John 16:4b-15 Introduction. This morning our scripture reading and special music have all been related to Palm Sunday in celebration of the day that Jesus made His triumphal entry into Jerusalem. That certainly was a special and exciting day.
The word elegxo refers to ânot only exposure but shame and convictionâ (Carson, John, 207). The Evangelist continues (3:20) by saying that those who refuse the Light actually hate the Light. This is followed by a contrast with those who âpractice the truth.â
The previous use of this word in the FG was at 13:10. In 15:5, being âapart fromâ the vine is contextually the opposite of abiding. The idea of being apart from the vine contains slight connotations to being the opposite of repentance.
Those additional things that Jesus wanted to say would come through the ministry of the Holy Spirit. Here in verse 13 the Spirit is again called the Spirit of Truth, but here Jesus adds that the Spirit will guide them into all truth.
If so, then 1:4b is a reference to personal holiness and not positional holiness. However, contextually, positional holiness seems to be the much preferred reading. For example, while 1:4 says that His choosing leads to our holiness, 1:5 says that Him predestining us leads to our adoption â¦ a positional concept.

Sherman Poppen attached two skis together in Muskegon, Mich., in 1965. His wife christened it the Snurfer and the kids loved it. He may have been inspired by a sled-like device made of plywood that first appeared in the 1920s. Poppen may have made the first snowboard; many say that he did. He certainly took a step in the evolution of snowboards. Dutch native Dimitrije Milovich, who slid down the hills of Ithaca, N.Y., on trays from the Cornell cafeteria, also seems to have strong claim on the first actual snowboard.

He added bindings to keep their boots secure. (Randy Lee October 14, 2014) The Snurfer was believed to be fairly simple and had no bindings, but this is debatable. It is widely accepted that Jake Burton Carpenter (founder of Burton Snowboards) and/or Tom Sims (founder of Sims Snowboards) invented modern snowboarding. In 1981, a couple of Winterstick team riders went to France at the invitation of Alain Gaimard, marketing director at Les Arcs.
Who Invented Snowboarding? Tom Sims invented snowboarding when he built the first snowboard in 1963. Growing up in New Jersey, the young surfer and skateboarder became frustrated when ice and snow prevented him from pursuing his passion for board sports during the winter months.
Digital Vision/Digital Vision/Getty Images. Tom Sims invented snowboarding when he built the first snowboard in 1963. Growing up in New Jersey, the young surfer and skateboarder became frustrated when ice and snow prevented him from pursuing his passion for board sports during the winter months.
The next major advance came in 1982, when Sims put metal edges on his snowboard so it could be used in a wider variety of snow conditions. He went on to improve and expand the sport over the years, introducing new snowboarding styles, bindings and designs.
The first real ski technology for snowboards was introduced by Burton and Winterstick in 1980. Their new prototype had a P-Tex base. In 1982 the first international snowboard race was held in Suicide Six, outside of Woodstock, Vermont.
By 1986, although still very much a minority sport, commercial snowboards started appearing in leading French ski resorts. In 2008, selling snowboarding equipment was a $487 million industry. In 2008, average equipment ran about $540 including board, boots, and bindings.
Snowboards are boards that are usually the width of one's foot longways, with the ability to glide on snow. Snowboards are differentiated from monoskis by the stance of the user. In monoskiing, the user stands with feet inline with direction of travel (facing tip of monoski/downhill) (parallel to long axis of board), whereas in snowboarding, users stand with feet transverse (more or less) to the longitude of the board.
Hedy Lamarr: Movie star, inventor of WiFi. Hollywood is a place where folks are often recognized more for their looks than their talent - and actress Hedy Lamarr was no exception. But it's what she invented in her spare time - to help end that war - that has history turning a kinder eye, linking her to a bombshell of a whole different sort. Lee Cowan reports: She possessed the kind of beauty that was haunting - an almost smoldering sensuality, with an exotic accent to match.
The typical Wi-Fi setup contains one or more Access Points (APs) and one or more clients. An AP broadcasts its SSID (Service Set Identifier, Network name) via packets that are called beacons, which are broadcasted every 100ms.
Wi-Fi or WiFi (/ËwaÉª faÉª/) is a technology that allows electronic devices to connect to a wireless LAN (WLAN) network, mainly using the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands.
Also the firmware running on the client Wi-Fi card is of influence. Say two AP's of the same SSID are in range of the client, the firmware may decide based on signal strength (Signal-to-noise ratio) to which of the two AP's it will connect.

The first version of the wireless protocol's legacy is now obsolete and would be considered dreadfully slow by todayâs standards. It had a maximum data transfer rate of 2 Mbps, or Megabits per second. Most applications created today would not be able to operate efficiently at those speeds.
But where did it come from? In 1985, the technology called 802.11 was made available for use due to a U.S. Federal Communication Commission ruling, which released the three bands of the radio spectrum now used for nearly all wireless communication: 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz.
Following are a few facts about WiFi: Back in 1991 Wi-Fi was invented by NCR Corporation/AT&T (later on Lucent & Agere Systems) in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. Initially meant for cashier systems the first wireless products were brought on the market under the name WaveLAN with speeds of 1Mbps/2Mbps. Vic Hayes who is the inventor of Wi-Fi has been named 'father of Wi-Fi' and was with his team involved in designing standards such as IEEE 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g.
When the IEEE was formed in 1990, they chose Vic Hayes, also popularly known as the Father of Wi-Fi, as its chairman. For the next ten years, Hayes helped direct the development of new wireless protocols as well as market the technology worldwide.
Wireless Revolution: The History of WiFi. Believe it or not, there was a time when if you wanted to get on the Internet your only option was to have a phone cable or Ethernet cable plugged directly into your computer or laptop.
So that's what Bezirksschornsteinfegermeister means. What was once the longest word in the German language, a tongue consisting of many ridiculously lengthy words, is no more. A regional parliament recently repealed the legislative measure, which was established in 1999, rendering the word obsolete.
This earns the word a Guinness World Record. It is also one of the longest monosyllabic words of the English language. 8 Euouae is six letters long, but all of the letters are vowels. It holds two Guinness World Records.

Question: What is the longest word in Spanish? Answer: The answer depends on what you mean by the longest word, but regardless of your definition the longest word isn't superextraordinarÃ­simo, the 22-letter word once listed in a famous recordbook and the word that was usually cited as the longest in the language. (It means most superextraordinary.)
A man has been recorded spending more than three hours to pronounce what is supposedly the longest word in the English language. 'Methionylthreonylthreonylglutaminylarginyl...isoleucine' is the chemical name of 'titin' (also known as 'connectin') - the largest known protein.

The longest word in the Oxford English Dictionary is 'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis' at 45 letters long. 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious', made famous by Mary Poppins, is 34 letters long. > 'Amazeballs', 'mummy porn', 'frenemy' make Collins online dictionary.
The classic longest German word is DonaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitÃ¤n, which in English becomes four words: Danube steamship company captain.. More than most other languages, German tends to string words together to form new vocabulary. All languages, including English, do this to some extent, but German takes it to new extremes.
What was once the longest word in the German language, a tongue consisting of many ridiculously lengthy words, is no more. The term rindfleischetikettierungsÃ¼berwachungsaufgabenÃ¼bertragungsgesetz â that's 63 letters long for those of you keeping track at home â means the law for the delegation of monitoring beef labeling..
Another reason why there really isn't a single longest German word: German numbers, long or short, are written as one word. For example, to say or write the number 7,254, not really a very long number, the German is siebentausendzweihundertvierundfÃ¼nfzig, a single word of 38 letters.

Your ZIP code is. Hi, my name is Jonatan Heyman. I made this website in a few hours on a train, while commuting to Stockholm. More than once I've needed the zip code/postal code for the place Iâm currently at, and the swedish postal serviceâs website is pretty bad. This is my attempt to solve this problem. I've also made a canadian specific postal code website for finding Canada postal codes.
What is a zip code/postal code? In the United States of America a zipcode is five or nine numbers that are added to a postal address to assist the sorting of mail. There are currently about 43,000 zipcode. This tool can also find the postal code of many other countries.

What's my Zip Code - Find the zip code of your current location. We have found the zip code you are likely in using your general area. To get your exact zipcode please share your location. You can also find the zipcode of any address or point clicked on the map. Searching for a city may not give you a result as there are many zip codes within a city. if this is the case click within the city limits to find the zip code of that spot.
Most of the postal code systems are numeric; only a few are alphanumeric (i.e. use both letters and digits). Alphanumeric systems can, given the same number of characters, encode many more locations. For example: with a 2 digit numeric code we could code 10 x 10= 100 locations.
In some countries (such as those of continental Europe, where a numeric postcode format of four or five digits is commonly used) the numeric postal code is sometimes prefixed with a country code when sending international mail to that country.
A postal code (also known locally in various English-speaking countries throughout the world as a postcode, post code, Eircode, PIN Code or ZIP Code ) is a series of letters and/or digits, sometimes including spaces or punctuation, included in a postal address for the purpose of sorting mail.

If your career goal is to become a pathologist's assistant, you will need to get the appropriate training first. This is a good career choice for someone who is methodical and who has an interest in science.
Salary Range and Outlook. New program graduate salaries range from $75,000 to $90,000 with experienced pathologistsâ assistants earning $100,000 or more annually. Factors that influence a pathologistsâ assistantâs salary include experience, workload, setting and regional cost of living. Sign-on, retention and annual bonuses are commonplace.
Once students are finished their post-secondary training to become a pathologist's assistant, they may need to be certified by the state where will be working to be fully qualified. An online search can give you more information about the requirements for becoming certified to do this kind of work.
Therefore, all pathologists must have completed a medical degree from an accredited medical school, and have completed clinical training in pathology. The duration of medical residency training in pathology is four to five years after the completion of medical school. While autopsies are a large component of pathologists' work, performing autopsies is actually only part of what pathologists do.

1 Wait two to four months to re-seed the lawn after using a pre-emergent herbicide. 2  Use a pre-emergent herbicide during late winter or during early spring of the next year to prevent any crabgrass seeds left behind from developing at the next opportunity.f the crabgrass seeds have already sprouted and crabgrass has appeared in your grass, the pre-emergent herbicide will do no good. However, you still have an option. Post-emergent herbicide products control crabgrass after it has already germinated. Post-emergent herbicides work by killing the crabgrass plants.
When to Apply Crabgrass Preventer. Crabgrass seeds germinate in the early Spring when the temperature of the surface soil rises into the 50s and 60s. Once the seeds germinate, the opportunity for prevention is passed.

The DNA polymerases are enzymes that create DNA molecules by assembling nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. These enzymes are essential to DNA replication and usually work in pairs to create two identical DNA strands from a single original DNA molecule.
DNA polymerases are responsible for adding nucleotides to the strands of new DNA being created. They are also responsible for replacing the RNA primers with DNA.
DNA polymerase is the enzyme that joins nucleotides together to make a new DNA strand. Other proteins separate the original DNA strands, but DNA polymerase makes new DNA.
answered Mar 8, 2012 by hcbiochem Level 2 User (2,140 points). DNA polymerase is the enzyme that joins nucleotides together to make a new DNA strand. Other proteins separate the original DNA strands, but DNA polymerase makes new DNA.
How might the double-helix structure of DNA make that possible? Copying the Code What role does DNA polymerase play in copying DNA? DNA polymerase is an __________________ that joins individual nucleotides to produce a new strand of DNA.
The second two activities of DNA Pol I are important for replication, but DNA Polymerase III (Pol III) is the enzyme that performs the 5'-3' polymerase function.
DNA ligase is responsible for joining together fragments of DNA. In DNA replication, after the primers are replaced by DNA Polymerase I, DNA ligase assists in the formation ph â¦ osphodiester bonds between the fragments. This is essential for creating one continuous strand.
A number of proteins are associated with the replication  fork, which helps in terms of the initiation and continuation of  DNA synthesis. One protein, the DNA polymerase, creates the  new DNA by adding complementary nucleotides to the template strand.
The role that enzymes plays in DNA replication is that the enzyme helicase breaks hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases, and the chains separate.
DNA polymerase is the primary enzyme responsible for DNA  replication. Two of its major roles are: the polymerization of  dNTP's or deoxyribonucleotides, and to proofread th â¦ e new copies.
It certainly depends on how the Chinese respond.... If they're seen to be basically positive, this represents a chance to improve U.S.-China relations that hasn't existed since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and indeed since 1989, with the Tianamen massacre.

Learn more about high blood pressure and its risk factors. It is important for everyone to know the facts about high blood pressure [PDF-255K]. About 75 million American adults (29%) have high blood pressureâthatâs 1 of every 3 adults.1.
The only way to know (diagnose) if you have high blood pressure (HBP or hypertension) is to have your blood pressure tested. Understanding your blood pressure numbers is key to controlling high blood pressure. Learn whatâs considered normal, as recommended by the American Heart Association. Blood Pressure.
Blood pressure is influenced by cardiac output, total peripheral resistance and arterial stiffness and varies depending on situation, emotional state, activity, and relative health/disease states. In the short term it is regulated by baroreceptors which act via the brain to influence nervous and endocrine systems.
Blood Pressure Levels Vary by Age. Women are about as likely as men to develop high blood pressure during their lifetimes. However, for people younger than 45 years old, the condition affects more men than women. For people 65 years old or older, high blood pressure affects more women than men.2.
Your blood pressure numbers and what they mean. Your blood pressure is recorded as two numbers: Systolic blood pressure (the upper number) â indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats. Diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) â indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls while the heart is resting between beats.
Mean arterial pressure. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) is a term used in medicine to describe an average blood pressure in an individual. It is defined as the average arterial pressure during a single cardiac cycle.
Management. 1  Patients with a MAP that is under or above set goal values should be treated with fluids, blood products, vasopressors, inotropes, or vasodilators depending on the clinical scenario.
Quick Answer. A normal range for mean arterial blood pressure is 70 to 110, according to GlobalRPh. A minimum of 60 is required to supply enough blood to nourish the coronary arteries, brain and kidneys. If mean arterial pressure falls below 60 for an appreciable length of time, vital organs can be deprived of oxygen.
In 1900, with the approval of Western League president Ban Johnson, Charles Comiskey moved the Saints into his hometown neighborhood of Armour Square, Chicago, where they became known as the White Stockings, the former name of Chicago's National League team, the Orphans (now the Chicago Cubs).
The White Sox would end May on a high note as they swept the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, to improve to 27-31 on June 1st. With a 1-0 win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley on July 2nd, the White Sox got back to .500, as Phillip Humber out dueled Matt Garza.
Several White Sox teams have received nicknames over the years: 1  The 1906 team were known as the Hitless Wonders, due to their .230 batting average, worst in the American League. 2  The 1919 White Sox are known as the Black Sox, after 8 players were banned from baseball for fixing the 1919 World Series.
Original name of the Chicago Cubs, named after the White Stockings that the players wore.
1903: The White Stockings struggle all season falling into seventh place with a disappointing record of 60-77. 1904: With their name shortened to White Sox, the team climbs back in to contention finishing within six games of first place with a solid 89-65 record that landed them in third place.

The bottle bill falls by the wayside. IF YOU were shopping for beer in, say, the 1940's, you had a pretty simple job. All you did was pick a brand and you were on your way. You paid for the beer and made the deposit on the bottles, and, when you'd emptied the bottles, you'd bring them back and collect the deposit.
State Beverage Container Deposit Laws. 12/15/2014. Beverage container deposit laws, or bottle bills, are designed to reduce litter and capture bottles, cans, and other containers for recycling. Ten states and Guam have a deposit-refund system for beverage containers. The chart below contains a citation and summary of each state law.
When the House considered the bottle bill in 1977, the bill was supported by only 42 representatives, while 124 others opposed it. This year, after almost two hours of testimony on March 29, the committee again rejected the bottle bill(H.B. 5) by a9-to-4 vote.
Oregon Bottle Bill. Carbonated beverage containers, like the plastic bottles shown here, are sold with refundable deposits.

Container deposit legislation in the United States. There are ten states in the United States with container deposit legislation, popularly called bottle bills after the Oregon Bottle Bill, the first such legislation that was passed. Efforts to pass container deposit legislation in states that do not have them are often politically contentious.
Oregonâs Bottle Bill was introduced in 1971 as the very first bottle bill in the U.S. The bill was created to address a growing litter problem along Oregon beaches, highways and other public areas. Over the years, the Bottle Bill has prompted several other green initiatives.
Spurred by the apparent success of the Oregon bill, Vermont, Iowa, Maine, Connecticut, Delaware and Michigan have adopted similar measures in recent years. The California legislature is also considering a bottle bill proposal. Michigan voters approved that state's bottle bill in a binding referendum on November 2, 1976.
Because the redemption was 68.26% in 2014 and 64.45% in 2015, the refund value will increase to 10Â¢ effective April 1, 2017. The same bill further expands the law effective January 1, 2018, that all beverage containers except distilled liquor, wine, dairy or plant-based milk, and infant formula will include a deposit.
For nearly 40 years, redemption centers did not exist in Oregon, but early in 2010, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission approved the first experimental distributor-run redemption center in Wood Village, and later, Oregon City.

Some hearing officers require that all documents or exhibits be introduced at the beginning of the hearing. The exhibits will be numbered or lettered and then entered into evidence. Any objections or arguments about the exhibit's relevance or reliability are made at this time.
Federal Laws vs. State Laws. Federal laws, or statutes, are created by the United States Congress to safeguard the citizens of this country. Some criminal acts are federal offenses only and must be prosecuted in U.S. District Court.
(December 2006) The law of evidence also known as the rules of evidence, encompasses the rules and legal principles that govern the proof of facts in a legal proceeding. These rules determine what evidence must or must not be considered by the trier of fact in reaching its decision.
Criminal acts fall into two categories: felonies and misdemeanors. Felonies are offenses that may result in prison sentences of more than one year, while misdemeanors carry sentences of one year or less. The United States Congress decides which criminal acts are felonies and which ones are misdemeanors.
Advances in technology have led to the use of various digital techniques in the presentation of evidence to the courts. In some cases, digital techniques have allowed the court to gain more valuable information from evidence than would otherwise have been evident.
Though not stated, implicit in the ruling of both the trial court and the Court of Appeals of Minnesota is the acceptance of the digital imaging evidence that was presented by the defence. Nooner v. State of Arkansas, 907 S.W.2d 677 (October 9, 1995, Supreme Court of Arkansas) Facts.
If documents are entered as evidence, the side that presents the evidence must be able to prove that it is authentic and must be able to show the chain of custody from the original document creator to the person who now holds it. There are other factors that may render evidence inadmissible in court.
The ability to convince the court that digital evidence is worthy of reception into the criminal process is dependent on the qualifications and competence of the tendered expert, the skill and knowledge of the prosecutor in leading such evidence and the quality of the digital evidence itself.
Admissible Evidence. In a criminal case, evidence is important to both the prosecution and defense. When evidence is entered before the judge or jury, it is important that it is relevant, reliable and not prejudiced. If the evidence meets all of these requirements, it is referred to as admissible evidence.
Exhibits are anything other than testimony that can be perceived by the senses and presented at the trial or hearing. Exhibits include:  Real evidence â tangible objects such as clothes, weapons, tools.  Demonstrative evidence â evidence that represents or illustrates the real thing such as photos, videos, diagrams, maps, charts.

They can be used to bind demons, protect an area from angelic and demonic interference, and conceal humans from every angel in creation.. The Whore of Babylon uses what appears to be an Enochian spell to harm Castiel.
The term Enochian comes from Dee's assertion that the Biblical Patriarch Enoch had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

So the angelic language, the angels utilized in the enochian calls, cannot be the angelic language, but only one kind of it, transformed into a linear timeflow. So it is of high importance that you actually evoke these images, emotions or thought-patterns during uttering the angelic language, called enochian.ccording to the angels that spoke during the sessions, the language that appears throughout the enochian calls is the one that was used by the angels that transferred Enoch into heaven.

In order to explain Enochian sigils we must first discuss Enochian as it is understand, as a language. Enochian is a language which has been said for hundreds of years to be the language which unites mankind with the Angels in heaven.he sigils which are associated with Enochian are the symbols in the alphabet themselves for which the Enochians owe their success.

You're responsible for the appraiser's fee: Paying for the appraiser falls in the shoulders of the home buyer. For most loans, a typical property appraisal takes a few hours or less and costs around $300 or $400.
What is a house appraisal? A house appraisal is an estimate of a property's value. Mortgage lenders require an appraisal on your home before theyâll provide a loan for the simple reason that the property is the underlying asset that serves as collateral for the loan.
Appraisers have complained for years about the size of the cut appraisal management companies pay themselves. The action by the Louisiana board is the first disciplinary action taken by a state agency on the issue of fees and is likely to be closely watched by the industry.

I am shopping around for a mortgage. Plugged in some numbers at Capital One. The program spit some numbers back at me. I noticed there is an Appraisal Fee AND an Appraisal Management Fee. What the heck is an Appraisal Management Fee???
Yes, its a junk fee. Some brokers and banks have figured out another way to add revenue to their origination fees. The appraisals today are ordered through an AMC (required) and usually the AMC gets their payment by taking a large portion of the fee that goes to the actual appriaser. Most lenders have an ownership interest in an AMC and naturally that is who they order the appraisal through.
dont pick a lender based on one small fee. it is a legit fee..... though some dont agree that the amt is necessary . if a lender doesnt show that fee on the hud..... then it is hidden in the price of the appraisal. some lenders do not seperate the fees onn the hud... we dont. we include it in the price of the appraisal. less confusing.
One way to do that is by hiring appraisal management companies, which hire the appraisers and set their fees, keeping a portion of the fees for themselves. Dodd-Frank requires the companies to pay appraisers fees that are considered customary and reasonable..
Re: Appraisal Management Fee??? The owners have decided to do owner financing...so I am going through the learning curve on this one. I have checked into owner financing before, but recently.
An appraisal management company has agreed to pay a $5,000 administrative fee and adopt a fee schedule after an investigation by the Louisiana Real Estate Appraisal Board found the company wasn't paying appraisers customary and reasonable fees as required under the federal Dodd-Frank financial services reform law, enacted in 2010.
The difference between libel and slander is simply whether the statements are written (libel) or spoken (slander). If a person suffers injury to his or her reputation as a result of another person's statements, he or she can sue under the theory of defamation.
Defamation, Libel and Slander. Not all torts result in bodily harm. Some cause harm to a person's reputation instead. Defamation is the general tort that encompasses statements that damage one's reputation. There are different forms of defamation, including libel and slander.
For other uses, see Libel (disambiguation) and Slander (disambiguation). Defamationâalso calumny, vilification, and traducementâis the communication of a false statement that harms the reputation of an individual person, business, product, group, government, religion, or nation.
Libel, on the other hand, is the written publication of a defamatory remark that has the tendency to injure another's reputation or character. Libel also includes a publication on radio, audio or video.
Defamation Law Made Simple. Learn the basics of slander and libel -- the rules about who can say what without getting into legal hot water. Defamation is a catch-all term for any statement that hurts someone's reputation. Defamation is not a crime, but it is a tort (a civil wrong, rather than a criminal wrong).
Under common law, to constitute defamation, a claim must generally be false and must have been made to someone other than the person defamed. Some common law jurisdictions also distinguish between spoken defamation, called slander, and defamation in other media such as printed words or images, called libel. False light laws protect against statements which are not technically false, but which are misleading.
No, for an action in libel to be upheld, the publisher of a defamatory statement need not know that a statement is false or defamatory. The law concerns the intent of the publisher in communicating a defamatory statement and is not concerned with the knowledge of the publisher.
What is the difference between libel and slander? Libel and slander are both forms of defamation. Defamation is a common law tort, governed by state law, in which an individual makes a publication of a defamatory statement of and concerning the plaintiff that damages the reputation of the plaintiff. The distinction between slander and libel comes in the form of the publication. Slander involves the oral publication of a defamatory remark that is heard by another, which injures the subject's reputation or character. Slander can occur through the use of a hand gesture or verbal communication that is not recorded.
Defamation is a catch-all term for any statement that hurts someone's reputation. Written defamation is called libel, and spoken defamation is called slander.. Defamation is not a crime, but it is a tort (a civil wrong, rather than a criminal wrong). A person who has been defamed can sue the person who did the defaming.
Libel is defined as defamation by written or printed words, pictures, or in any form other than by spoken words or gestures. The law of libel originated in the 17th century in England. With the growth of publication came the growth of libel and development of the tort of libel.
A. A. A. Genital herpes is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Most cases of genital herpes are caused by infection by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).enital herpes virus is passed from one person to another through sexual contact. This happens even if the person with the virus doesn't have symptoms or signs of infection. Once the virus enters through the skin, it travels along nerve paths. It may become dormant (inactive) in the nerves and remain there indefinitely.
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is more often the cause of cold sores or fever blisters. But it can also be a cause of genital herpes. Most people with genital herpes don't know they have it. That's because in most people it produces either no symptoms or very mild ones.enital herpes virus is passed from one person to another through sexual contact. This happens even if the person with the virus doesn't have symptoms or signs of infection. Once the virus enters through the skin, it travels along nerve paths.

In this article. Herpes simplex viruses -- more commonly known as herpes -- are categorized into two types: herpes type 1 (HSV-1, or oral herpes) and herpes type 2 (HSV-2, or genital herpes). Most commonly, herpes type 1 causes sores around the mouth and lips (sometimes called fever blisters or cold sores).HSV-1 can cause genital herpes, but most cases of genital herpes are caused by herpes type 2. In HSV-2, the infected person may have sores around the genitals or rectum.erpes simplex type 1, which is transmitted through oral secretions or sores on the skin, can be spread through kissing or sharing objects such as toothbrushes or eating utensils. In general, a person can only get herpes type 2 infection during sexual contact with someone who has a genital HSV-2 infection.
Two types of herpes simplex virus infections can cause genital herpes: 1  HSV-1. 2  This is the type that usually causes cold sores or fever blisters around your mouth, though it can be spread to your genital area during oral sex. 3  Recurrences are much less frequent than they are with HSV-2 infection.

Genital herpes often affects the 20-24 year old age group, with around 30,000 new cases diagnosed in sexual health clinics in the UK each year.
Genital herpes is not the only condition that can produce these symptoms. Sometimes, HSV is mistaken for vaginal yeast infections, bacterial infections, or bladder infections. The only way to know whether they are the result of HSV or another condition is to be checked by a health care provider.ny of the following symptoms of a genital HSV infection can occur in a man or a woman: 1  Cracked, raw, or red areas around your genitals without pain, itching, or tingling.

Genital herpes can cause sores or breaks in the skin or lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum. The genital sores caused by herpes can bleed easily. When the sores come into contact with the mouth, vagina, or rectum during sex, they increase the risk of giving or getting HIV if you or your partner has HIV.epeat outbreaks of genital herpes are common, especially during the first year after infection. Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe than the first outbreak. Although the infection can stay in the body for the rest of your life, the number of outbreaks tends to decrease over a period of years.

So, the answer to your first question is No. Telekinesis is the power to move/control matter with only your mind. Itâs when you show âmind over matterâ, when you have control over atoms/sub-atomic particles/ objects in general. No-one really knows how it works. How does your brain move things you cant actually touch?
The Thermacell Mosquito Repellent appliance is an outdoor device used to repel mosquitos within a 15â² x 15â² area. I found it to be an effective tool when repelling mosquitoes. This handheld appliance is also lightweight, portable and easy to use.
The ThermaCELL appliance uses a butane cartridge to heat up a small mat thatâs soaked in mosquito repellent. Donât worry â there are no open flames so itâs safe to use around fabric and children. As the mat warms, the repellent is released into the air. Each appliance comes with one butane cartridge and three mats.
The above were sent to me to review. The Thermacell Mosquito Repellent shown in the center of the above photo is the basic kit. The Thermacell Holster with Clip, the All-Purpose Swivel Light, and the Mosquito Repellent Refills are all accessories that must be purchased separately.
ThermaCELL Mosquito Repellent: Product Review. If youâre a mosquito magnet like me, youâre always looking for ways to keep the pesky critters at bay. Choices mostly involve covering yourself in smelly sprays or lighting smoky and smelly coils or candles. The ThermaCELL âapplianceâ is neither of those.
ThermaCELLÂ® Mosquito Repellent â Olive Drab Appliance. If citronella candles and other old-fashioned methods for keeping mosquitoes away just arenât working for you, fire up the ThermaCELL Portable repellent and enjoy your next outing in bug-free peace.
The ThermaCELL Mosquito Repellent Appliance is effective at repelling mosquitoes within a 225 square foot area when thereâs little air movement; great for use when sitting outside on a deck or patio. Itâs less effective in breezy conditions or when youâre moving around outside of a 15â by 15â area.
What is the ThermaCELL Mosquito Repellant Appliance? âApplianceâ is a strange name but itâs hard to come up with something better. Itâs an 8â by 3â device that emits a repellant that keeps mosquitoes and black flies away. Thereâs no need to spray yourself and thereâs hardly any odor.
Reason to use the Thermacell Mosquito Repellent. West Nile Virus: The West Nile virus is present here in Texas and is transmitted by mosquitoes (FYI, only female mosquitoes bite â they need at least one blood meal in order to develop their eggs).
The Thermacell Mosquito Repellent appliance is made almost entirely of hard plastic with the exception of the metal plate that is used to heat the repellent mat which volatilizes the insecticide. The front of the appliance contains an On/Off switch that releases or shuts off the butane.
Included with the Thermacell Mosquito Repellent is a repellent kit that includes three repellent mats and a butane cartridge. The repellent mat slides into the appliance from the side. It is a tight fit so that the mat will not slip out when carrying the appliance.

Oxygen has an atomic number of 8 which means there are 8 protons in the nucleus and 8 electrons orbiting the nucleus. This balance keeps oxygen as a neutral element as you see it on the periodic table. The columns 1-18 are groups or families. These elements are grouped by commonalities.
The vertical columns in the periodic table are referred to as groups and the horizontal rows are referred to as periods. The number of groups in each block of the periodic table depends on the sub shell that is being filled. Periodic table is the framework of classification of elements.
In the periodic table of the elements, each numbered column is a group. In chemistry, a group (also known as a family) is a column of elements in the periodic table of the chemical elements. There are 18 numbered groups in the periodic table, and the f-block columns (between groups 3 and 4) are not numbered. The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics of the outermost electron shells of their atoms (i.e., the same core charge), as most chemical properties are dominated by the orbital location of the outermost electron.

Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarejevo. Gavrilo Princip was a member of the Black Hand, a Serbian nationalist group.
On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, were shot dead in Sarajevo, by Gavrilo Princip, one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins coordinated by Danilo IliÄ.
REUTERS/JU Muzej Sarajevo (JU Sarajevo Museum)/Handout via Reuters. One hundred years ago today in Sarajevo, a Serb nationalist shot to death at point-blank range the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his wife Sophie.
Best Answer: Though Gavrilo Princip killed Franz Ferdinand, he was just a pawn in a huge assasination plan by the Black Hand, a Serbian freedom fighter group, who hoped to eliminate the Archduke due to the fact that the Archduke planned to give concessions to the South Slavs, therefore making a unified Greater Serbia more difficult to obtain.
Gavrilo Princip, an assassin affiliated with the Serbian Black Hand terrorist organization killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
On the eve of the centennial, Bosnian Serbs unveiled a statue to Gavrilo Princip, the archduke's killer, who is considered a Serbian hero and freedom-fighter.
Indeed, in Europe and across the pond in the United States, many learning of the archduke's death were less concerned with the drumbeats of war than the question of Austrian succession. The Washington Post, for example, published this largely fluffy piece on the royal who became the heir presumptive:
The Shifting Legacy Of The Man Who Shot Franz Ferdinand. The Shifting Legacy Of The Man Who Shot Franz Ferdinand. Nineteen-year-old Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip fired the shots that killed the heir to the Austro-Hungarian empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, Sophie, during a visit to Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. Depending on whom you ask, he's either a hero or a terrorist.
The Archduke was killed by a group called the Black Hand by a man called Gavrilo Princip, due to the fact that the Serbians wanted freedom and independence which they didn t get, which made the Serbians want revenge, forming the terrorist group, The Black Hand and successfully killing Franz Ferdinand and his 6 month pregnant wife, Sophie.
This plan included 2 other conspirators,Nedjelko Cabrinovic, and Trifko Grabez, though they obviously all failed in their assasination attempts. The original plan was that these 3 people would kill the Archduke while he was driving though the streets of Sarajevo on his way to visit the city hall. Nedjelko, who made the first attempt, threw a grenade at the Archduke's car, but it instead missed, rolled underneath another car in the motorcade, and exploded.

The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.
If treatment is received within 8 hours of the overdose, however, there is a very good chance of recovery. For children who have taken acetaminophen in liquid form, a treatment decision may be made as soon as 2 hours after ingestion since the drug is absorbed more rapidly in this form. ^ Back to top.
The test for acetaminophen is used to measure the level of drug in the blood in order to establish a diagnosis of overdosage, to assess the risk of liver damage, and to help decide on the need for treatment. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important for a positive outcome.

Taking a pulse not only measures the heart rate, but also can indicate the following: Heart rhythm. Strength of the pulse. The normal pulse for healthy adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. The pulse rate may fluctuate and increase with exercise, illness, injury, and emotions. Females ages 12 and older, in general, tend to have faster heart rates than do males.
Blood pressure, measured with a blood pressure cuff and stethoscope by a nurse or other health care provider, is the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries, resulting in the highest blood pressure as the heart contracts. One cannot take his or her own blood pressure unless an electronic blood pressure monitoring device is used. Electronic blood pressure monitors may also measure the heart rate, or pulse.

Reasonable answers to this most perplexing of history's puzzlesâand there have been hundreds of answers advancedâbegin with understanding the complex nature of late Rome and the barbarian invasions in which the Roman Empire ultimately drowned.
Likewise, the climate and ecology of the time cannot be adduced as the reason for something so earth-shattering as the Fall of Rome. Nor do any of the other two hundred or so entries cited make the cut in history's time trials, meaning that no one answer has as yet won the day for why the Romans lost.
Select a Time Period: The Roman Empire began to slowly decline in the 3rd century AD, one of the main causes of Rome's early decline was a series of plagues, most notably the Plague of Cyprian, which decimated the population of the Empire, making it harder for Roman Emperors to levy armies and raise taxes.
Even if the Romans of Rome still held the title to the Empire and affected superiority over the barbarians managing their domain, Roman possession of the lands around the Mediterranean Sea was, for the most part, only on paper.
The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic, cultural, political and military forces in the world of its time. It was one of the largest empires in world history. At its height under Trajan, it covered 5 million square kilometres, a territory composed of 48 nations in the 21st century.
I. Introduction: Rome Before the Fall [click here for a brief overview of Roman history] After nearly half a millennium of rule, the Romans finally lost their grip on Europe in the fifth century (the 400's CE).
The imperial successor to the republic lasted approximately 1,500 years. The first two centuries of the empire's existence were a period of unprecedented political stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana, or Roman Peace. Following Octavian's victory, the size of the empire was dramatically increased.
Despite the travails of their Western counterparts, the Eastern emperorsâby then, there were two Roman emperors, one in Rome and one in Constantinopleâcontinued to demand that the entire Empire pay taxes into a common treasury.
The city of Rome was the largest city in the world c. 100 BC â c. 400 AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time).

There have been many innovations in the shapes of tea bags over the years. The earliest tea bags were sack-like in shape. Later, tea bags became flat and rectangular. In the 1950s, Lipton invented the multi-dimensional Flo-Thru tea bag, which gave leaves more room to open.
Oolong, a Chinese name for âblack dragon,â is a light, floral tea that, like green tea, is also packed with catechins, which help to promote weight loss by boosting your bodyâs ability to metabolise lipids (fat).
One part of the documentary covered Lipton tea and how it's made from many blends of tea. Up to 40 different kinds of black tea. So your lipton tea is basically a blend to get that lipton taste, so you never know where it's from or what kind of black tea it is. A tea taster would sip different teas and give them a number, then they would blend them according to these numbers to get that familiar taste.
I've been drinking Lipton Diet Green Tea Citrus for several years. I purchased a 12 pack of bottles at Walmart on Oct 7th of this year. The first bottle I only drank half of because it hardly had any taste and no sweetness at all. I also noticed that it had some brown sediment in the bottom of the bottle.
Hey, I heard that lipton tea is the best, but I want to know which flavor is the best,. Thanks. If you're limited to Lipton, I would say go for the pyramid style bags if you can find them. The bedtime story blend is actually pretty decent. If you're limited to tea bags, my advice would be to go for a loose leaf tea and just purchase a reusable tea bag to place the loose leaf tea in.
It will even be called a Lipton like people may say a NescafÃ© (instead of a cup of coffee). Now this is my experience from living in the Middle East (Arabian Gulf) where the majority population is migrant South Asian. I'm sure there is variety in tea habits on the actual subcontinent.
Tea is not as fresh as it used to be before new packaging. The tea labels disintegrate when I drop the bags in hot water. After 30 years of being a Lipton tea lover, I am ready to hunt a better tea. I always have bought the 100 single bag count regular brew.
After 50 years of drinking Lipton tea every day (in recent years from tea bags in the 100 box), I am abandoning this product. Life is too short to drink bad tea, and Lipton is no longer of good quality on a consistent basis. Frequently now it is just not even drinkable.

T/F: Air is the medium that sound waves travel through. T/F: Sound waves are a disturbance that moves through the air. T/F: Air molecules are carried along with sound waves. T/F: The speed of a wave depends on the medium through which it travels.
Shock Waves and Sonic Booms. The Doppler effect is observed whenever the speed of the source is moving slower than the speed of the waves. But if the source actually moves at the same speed as or faster than the wave itself can move, a different phenomenon is observed.
Asked by: Lockyear. Sonic boom is a common name for the loud noise that is created by the 'shock wave' produced by the air-plane that is traveling at speeds greater than that of sound ( speed of sound is approximately 332 m/s or 1195 km/hr or 717 miles/hour). These speeds are called supersonic speeds, hence this phenomena is sometimes called the supersonic boom.
I myself think that it is D, cause a sonic boom is caused when you break the sound barrier (speed of sound) so you need to be above the speed of sound, hope it helps 1  :) Comments (5) 2  Report.

circle the letter that describes how increasing the speed of the wave source above the wave speed affects the shape of the bow wave that is formed. a. the bow wave is unchanged. b. the bow wave has a narrower v shape.
This phenomenon is known as a shock wave. Shock waves are also produced if the aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound. If a moving source of sound moves faster than sound, the source will always be ahead of the waves that it produces.
The Doppler effect can be observed to occur with all types of waves - most notably water waves, sound waves, and light waves. The application of this phenomenon to water waves was discussed in detail in Unit 10 of The Physics Classroom Tutorial.
Which best describes when a sonic boom occurs? A. when a object travels at or above the speed of sound. B. when an object travels at the speed of sound. C.When an object travels below the speed of sound. D. When an object travels above the speed of sound.
suppose a friend far away taps a metal fence. a. the sound is softer and travels slower through the metal than through air. b.the sound is louder and travels slower through the metal than through air. c. the sound is softer and travels faster through the metal than through air. d. the sound is louder and travels faster through the metal than through air.
And you need to take that course in order to take the next one, so you're really set back if you fail or couldn't sign up for a certain course. Plus, not that many engineering courses are offered over the summer. Most people I know take longer than 4 years.
If you donât take an internship you can get an engineering degree in four years but it might be more challenging for you to get your first job depending on whether you have high grades and whether you have some engineering experience from working as a summer student.

The program is intended for those interested in professional practice and engineering. The M.S. degree is a research-oriented program that usually takes 4 semesters to complete and requires an independently written thesis. There are no credit-hour or specific course requirements.
The M.Eng degree is set up to be completed in two semesters. No thesis is required; a final written report on the design project replaces the thesis. The program requires a minimum of 30 credit hours of technical graduate-level course work and work on a real-world design project.
Those interested in a terminal Masterâs degree should apply to the Master of Engineering program; others may apply for the combined MS/PhD program. Competition for these assistantships and fellowships is very keen and in general only about 5% of new M.S. (/Ph.D.) applicants will receive an offer of financial aid.
Master of Engineering (M.Eng); a coursework and project-oriented degree program usually completed in two semesters if started in the Fall. Admission to this program generally requires an undergraduate degree, or equivalent coursework, in an appropriate field of engineering.

A typical cellphone has enough power to reach a cell tower up to 45 miles away. Depending on the technology of the cellphone network, the maximum distance may be as low as 22 miles because the signal otherwise takes too long for the highly accurate timing of the cellphone protocol to work reliably.
i recently found out that the house i was about to rent is 75meter away from a big celltower so i want to cancel the contract tomorrow i ve read that the radiation being put out by the neighbours wifi and dect phones is much bigger than the radiation being put out by big cell tower at 75meters distance
hi i m not good with the technical stuff my sensitivity to emrs is at a purely instinctive level i just feel it as pain to differing levels of severity depending on where the source happens to be and how strong the emissions are but 75m is way too close to a cell tower
originally 300m was given as a minimum distance for people to live work play nearby and bear in mind that was long before the 2g 3g 4g tetra levels were introduced and blanket residential wi fi existed
i reside in ocean shores where telstra project of putting a 33m tower in the middle of a residential area 80 m away from the fist one and less that 300 m from 2 schools
carriers often reduce the distance between a cellphone and a cell tower due to capacity issues a cellphone carrier receives a certain number of frequencies to use in his network at a given location each cell tower can handle a maximum number of calls determined by the number of separate frequencies
i gave away my first cell phone after 6 days in 1999 then i went back to using cell phones but not that much then i started using them only with a headset now i like to leave it switched off the next step will be to throw it away
the maximum distance between a cellphone and a cell tower depends on many different factors the connecting technology landscape features the power of the transmitter in the tower the size of the cellphone network cell and the design capacity of the network all play a role sometimes the celltower transmitter is set to low power on purpose so that it doesn t interfere with neighboring cells

Take the milk: sheepâs milk, the classic feta ingredient, makes a creamy, yellowish cheese with a soft texture and a decidedly âbarnyardâ flavor. Pure goatâs milk feta, like Agrafa, tends to be whiter, drier and milder than sheep and often has a slightly gamy aftertaste.
Unlike a lot of other cheeses with geographically protected names, modern cheddar can come from anywhere, not just the area around Cheddar. Cheddar cheese eventually became one of Englandâs most popular snacks. In 1170, King Henry II bought over five tons of the cheese for the bargain price of just a little over Â£10.
3. Monterey Jack. Monterey Jack only takes half of its name from a place. Franciscan friars around Monterey, CA, crafted a mild white cheese throughout the 19th century, but the semi-hard treat didnât begin spreading until Scottish immigrant David Jack started marketing his own version of the cheese.
A World Away From Supermarket Feta. For people who are used to American supermarket feta, itâs hard to understand the incredible breadth of the cheese, much less the near-maniacal devotion that some brands engender.
Quick Answer. Feta cheese and goat cheese are both made from the milk of goats. The difference is that feta is also made using sheep's milk. In fact the majority, or 70 percent, of the milk used in feta is sheep's milk. Some feta is made entirely with sheep's milk.
The word feta has an interesting genealogy. It comes from the Italian word fetta (meaning slice). Fetta, in turn, is of Latin origin from offa (meaning bite or morsel). It first appeared in Greek language in the 17th century, possibly referring to the process of serving the cheese by cutting it in thin slices.
Served with a splash of olive oil and a sprinkle of herbs, it has complexity and character, and is the perfect accompaniment to go with a glass of retsina and a bowl of olives. Table cheese, in other words, describes a feta that isnât afraid to stand up to cheddar or manchego. Itâs a cheese that comes ready to play.
Feta is an aged brine curd cheese, which is usually made from ewe's or goat's milk. Usually formed in square-shaped blocks, it is known to have a somewhat grainy consistency. However, in today's world there is an abundance of Feta Style cheese made with cow milk.
Our Feta recipe is made with whole fat cow milk but ewe or goats milk can easily be used to achieve more traditional flavors. The recipe below is for 4.5 gallons of milk, if you would like to make a 2 gallon batch, simply reduce the culture and rennet and change the press weight as indicated below.
Cheddar, which has been around since at least the 12th century, takes its name from the English village of Cheddar. The nearby Cheddar Gorge is full of caves that offer ideal conditions for aging cheese, so dairy farmers and their wives began using their surplus milk to make a new kind of cheese.
Sounds and Noises a Refrigerator Makes. The normal operation of your refrigerator will cause some sound. The following list contains sounds that are normal. A Chirping/barking/woof/howl sound can sometimes be heard as the damper door opens/closes.
Hum a few bars, please. This is one instance when sound coming from your fridge is a good thing. You're probably so used to it you don't even notice the low humming your refrigerator typically makes. But sometimes it's the absence of sound that makes you take notice.
Sound coming from inside the fridge. The evaporation motor inside the fridge is supposed to get rid of excess moisture that could form ice inside your refrigerator. If the sound becomes louder when you open the fridge, then your evaporation motor is probably broken.
1 A clicking/tic toc noise can be heard when the defrost timer switches on and off. 2  A click can be heard when the temperature control unit turns the unit on and off.  A boiling, gurgling, or knocking sound can be heard when the unit is running. This is caused by the circulation of refrigerant.
You may be wondering, Why does my refrigerator make that noise?. Check out some common refrigerator woes and what they could mean. Even if you can't fix your fridge foibles yourself, you may be reassured to know what the issue might be. Consult a reputable repair person to assess any issues you may have.
The annoying humming noise thatâs coming from your fridge could be caused by a number of problems, some of which are easy to solve, some of which youâll need a quality mechanic for, and some that will force you to replace the machine. Read on if you have a refrigerator making humming noises and you want to fix it. Sound coming from the back. If the humming sound is coming from the back of the fridge, itâs either due to your compressor or the motor fan. A broken compressor is a big deal, as your fridge wonât cool properly.
If the sound is coming from the bottom of the fridge, this it could be because your fridge is off balance. Make sure your fridge is level and all the feet are bearing pressure equally. If one foot is only lightly touching the ground, it could create a humming sound as the fridge vibrates against the floor.
When something just clicks, it's usually a good thing. In the case of your fridge, however, you might not be so lucky. Clicking could mean your compressor is going bad. The unit might be struggling to get an electrical current to the compressor, overheat with the effort, shut off and make the clicking sound.
If your fridge begins to hiss or makes noises like a sizzle, it could be an issue with the defroster (most newer units are self defrosting). The noise can be a result of what happens when cold water drips onto the warm defroster.
1 A change in fan speed as the refrigerator responds to changes in temperature due to door opening. 2  A clicking/tic toc noise can be heard when the defrost timer switches on and off.  A click can be heard when the temperature control unit turns the unit on and off.

Gore-Tex takes a plain (unguarded) ePTFE membrane and attaches it to a superthin protective polyurethane (PU) film, creating what is known in the rainwear industry as a bicomponent laminate. The PU layer is solid (technically speaking, monolithic) and shields the ePTFE from body oils and other contaminants.
PU Coated Fabrics. Nobletex PU Coated Fabrics are made of the very toughest fabrics and is thoroughly tested to guarantee performance even after serious wear and tear, therefore provides rugged durable and excellent protection performance for a variety of end uses. Water proof & Water repellant.
All rainwear exteriors (also known as face fabrics) are treated with a durable water repellent (DWR) finish. Even rainwear classified as water-resistant (which includes soft shells) carries a DWR finish. A DWR affects only the exterior of rainwear and is separate from a laminate or coating. Its purpose is to protect the face fabric from becoming saturated, weighing it down and causing any sensation of dampness. A DWR accomplishes this by causing water to bead up and roll off the garment's exterior.

Take it one day at a time. Researchers continue to investigate arrhythmias, and they're making progress. The best thing you can do is to follow your treatment plan and take things one day at a time. Sometimes you may feel that you don't get the support you need and that the people around you aren't very understanding.
Individual Agents: The following are some beta blockers that are in current use: nadolol (Corgard), propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Toprol), carvedilol (Coreg) and labetalol. There are significant differences between many of the drugs in this class.
Calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers, also known as calcium antagonists, work by interrupting the movement of calcium into heart and blood vessel tissue. Besides being used to treat high blood pressure, they're also used to treat angina (chest pain) and/or some arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). Beta-blockers. Beta-blockers decrease the heart rate and cardiac output, which lowers blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenalin.
They can help prevent heart attack and stroke. They can also prevent complications and slow the progression of coronary heart disease. Some of the major types of commonly prescribed cardiovascular medications used to treat arrhythmias are summarized in this section.
There are three classes of diuretic drugs that are used to treat hypertension. Most commonly used are thiazide diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone. There is not usually an increased urine flow after the first one or two days of taking these medications.
Monitor your pulse. You should know how to take your pulse â especially if you have an artificial pacemaker. 1  Put the second and third fingers of one hand on the inside of the wrist of the other hand, just below the thumb OR on the side of your neck, just below the corner of your jaw.  Feel for the pulse.
All medications have side effects, including drugs to treat arrhythmias. Most of the side effects aren't serious and disappear when the dose is changed or the medication is stopped. But some side effects are very serious. That's why some children are admitted to the hospital to begin the medication.
If you're being treated for arrhythmia and use any of these substances, be sure to discuss this with your doctor. Manage your risk factors. Just having an arrhythmia increases your risk of heart attack, cardiac arrest and stroke.
Ethacrinic acid (Edecrin) is used in the rare patients who are allergic to diuretics. Loop diuretics are not as effective as thiazides in lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. They are used especially to treat edema (swelling of the ankles) or heart failure. However, unlike thiazides, they effective in patients with poor kidney function in lowering blood pressure or treating edema.

I also got a Buff Orpington hen from someone else, I was told she was hatched in Feb/Mar 2010. The 2 ex battery hens started laying soon after I got them and still are laying but my Buff Orpington still hav'nt started laying.
Itâs understandable that a first-time chicken-keeper may be anxious to know when they can reasonably expect to see the first egg in the nest box from their new flock. Here are general guidelines for what to watch for and how to help prepare a chicken to lay her first egg.
Different breeds have different amounts or shades of the pigment which accounts for Buff Orpingtons laying pale brown eggs, while Marans lay dark chocolate brown eggs. While the egg color is determined by breed and genetics within the breed, there are a few things you can do to ensure the darkest egg color.
At maturity they weigh around 6 pounds and should start laying large brown eggs at approximately 24 weeks. These pullets are not debeaked for better foraging and they free range on our farm. We also feed them healthy rations of all natural chicken feeds. All have been fully vaccinated.
See all reviews. Our first chickenOrdered a started Buff Orpington pullet. She arrived in great condition and has been living in her new home for 2 weeks. She laid an egg on the first day she arrived. She is a nice bird, docile and good with the children who are responsible for her care.
linda07965 Junior Member. My 11/12 month old buff orpington has finely layed her first egg, she must of known I posted a message on here last week lol. I went to the nest box 2 days ago and there was a cream/slight pinky small egg in there which is a complete different colour egg to what my 2 ex-battery hens lay.
One bantam was six months, the other was seven months, and the large fowl were both eight months old before laying. My 11/12 month old buff orpington has finely layed her first egg, she must of known I posted a message on here last week lol. I went to the nest box 2 days ago and there was a cream/slight pinky small egg in there which is a complete different colour egg to what my 2 ex-battery hens lay.
battery hens are bred to lay, and thats what they do non stop. orpingtons are dual purpose birds, so wont lay as many eggs and the larger breeds tend to start a bit later. 12 months is a bit late but weve had really bad , cold weather so that could delay her.
No matter what the breed or what color the egg ultimately ends up being, all eggshells are white when they start their journey down the oviduct. This journey takes about 26 hours, the shell taking roughly 20 hours to be completed. In the last 4-6 hours of the laying process brown eggs 'turn' brown. A hen spending too much time in the sunlight can actually have a bleaching effect on the color egg that a hen lays, as can not having access to cool water.
They are so named because they can lay a variety of shades of green (mint, pale, bright, olive), pinkish or cream eggs. A particular chicken will only lay one color egg her entire life, but each EE could lay a different color egg for you. Truly a mystery until she lays her first egg.
Option Pending-known as OP status means the contract is in an option period, this typically stays 7-14 days and also buyer needs to pay the option fee as well. In this case, the seller has no right to terminate the contract during this period, just only the buyer. about 3 years ago. 0 1.
It is the responsibility of the listing agent to bring offers made on the home to the bank or mortgage company for their approval or rejection. All short sales are pending the mortgage companies approval. The listing agent is just announcing in the listing that itâs a short sale listing. If you make an offer for the property it may take weeks before you get confirmation that your offer has been accepted and your deposit will be tied up until you have confirmation.
What does Pending Listing for Sale mean. We have an earnest money contract signed by both parties and credit pre-approved but today the language on Har changed from Pending to Pending listing for sale. I know the house was appraised 2 days ago but now concerned.
Listings with the status âpending releaseâ (status 2) or âpending continue to showâ (status 3) that state âno more offersâ or âno more showingsâ are incorrectly classified. If the property is not available to show or not accepting offers, the status should be âpending no showâ (status 4). A list of the different statuses and their uses can be found on the MLSListings Portal and below. Active â Valid listing contract exists and no offer has been accepted. Pending with release, continue to show (PR) or (Pend w/Rls) â Accepted offer on the property, and a release, âescapeâ or âkick-outâ clause exists in a purchase contract that allows one party to withdraw under certain circumstances.
âActive/Pending Short-Saleâ would mean the real estate agent has an offer that is waiting for approval from the bank AND the agent is still showing the house, hoping for better offers. All short-sale offers must be approved by the bank.
On March 26, 2015, HAR implemented the following update: 3 days after the Option End Date passes, the system automatically changes the listing from the Option Pending status to the Pending status.
Best Answer: It means a buyer made the seller an offer to purchase their house. The sellers accepted the buyer's offer. It is now in the 'Pending' status awaiting financing. It is off the market, pending mortgage approval. If the buyers can not qualify for a mortgage, the house will be back on the market usually in 30-60 days. Usually it is sold and you don't have a chance.
OP-Option Pending means that the buyer has paid a fee for the unrestricted right to terminate the contract during the 'option period'. The buyer and seller agree on the amount of the fee and the length of time for the option period.
Active/Pending = Usually that means the seller would like to get more offers. Savvy agents want back-up offers in place. If you made an offer to purchase a property and the seller agreed to the price, but already has a buyer in contract, you would be the 1st position back-up buyer.
If the seller and agent will not show or accept offers on a property for a period of time the status of the listing should be changed to âtemporarily withdrawnâ (status 8). This will indicate to the cooperating brokers and their client(s) that the seller is not actively soliciting offers and showings for the property.
Bandy The Rodeo Clown (song) Bandy the Rodeo Clown is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artists Sanger D. Shafer and Lefty Frizzell, and made famous by Moe Bandy. It was released in June 1975 as the title track from his third album, and was his final single from GRC Records.

Step 3: Calculate the base impedance. Step 4: Calculate the per unit impedance. The voltage ratio in equation (3) is not equivalent to transformers voltage ratio. It is the ratio of the transformerâs voltage rating on the primary or secondary side to the system nominal voltage on the same side.
A transformer is an electrical device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. A varying current in one coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a voltage in a second coil. Power can be transferred between the two coils through the magnetic field, without a metallic connection between the two circuits.
Using the ratings of the generator as base values determine the generated per unit voltage that is required to produce a full load current under short circuit condition. thanks a lotâ¦â¦â¦.com/2011/06/per-unit-system-practice-problem-solved-for-easy-understandi... 1380v generator has an internal impedance Zg of j6 ohms.

It is the ratio of the transformerâs voltage rating on the primary or secondary side to the system nominal voltage on the same side. 10/10/2014 .(1) For T-Line 1: = 484 Ohms For T-Line 2: = 121 Ohms For 3-phase load: = 1...Per Unit System .(2) â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦..
According to Faraday's law, since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding, according to eq. (1) in the secondary winding case, according to eq. (2) in the primary winding case.
For example, a motor with a 100 Horsepower (HP) nameplate rating which delivers 90 HP to a. dynamic load is said to be 90% loaded or 0.9 per unit. In this case, the per unit base is the nameplate. horsepower rating of 100. When the motor delivers 90 HP, 90/100 equals 0.9 per unit.
1. Transformers and per unit systems. The reason the per unit system is employed is because it simplifies calculation of currents. Imagine a 3-phase system with a generator, a transformer, a T-line, another transformer, and a load. Every time you cross the transformers, the currents and voltages change.

Co-developed by: The nervous system has two major parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central system is the primary command center for the body, and is comprised of the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of a network of nerves that connects the rest of the body to the CNS.
Most systems and organs of the body control just one function, but the central nervous system does many jobs at the same time. It controls all voluntary movement, such as speech and walking, and involuntary movements, such as blinking and breathing. It is also the core of our thoughts, perceptions, and emotions.

Definition of Central nervous system (CNS) Central nervous system (CNS): The central nervous system is that part of the nervous system that consists of the brain and spinal cord. The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the two major divisions of the nervous system. The other is the peripheral nervous system (PNS) which is outside the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) connects the central nervous system (CNS) to sensory organs (such as the eye and ear), other organs of the body, muscles, blood vessels and glands.

To a large extent, the future of the Internet of things will not be possible without the support of IPv6; and consequently, the global adoption of IPv6 in the coming years will be critical for the successful development of the IoT in the future. Short-range wireless Edit
Everything is Online. As already mentioned in the introduction, the Internet of Things means literally connecting things to the World Wide Web to make them remotely accessible. Right now, the Internet of Things is mostly made up of mobile devices such as phones, tablets, or computers. You know, things we use to access the online world.
Internet of things. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as connected devices and smart devices), buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.
Here are some ideas of connection WordPress and real-world things: 1  A bell that goes off whenever thereâs a new comment, sale, or plugin update on your site. 2  An IoT lamp that lights up when you receive or answer a new ticket. 3  Push notifications if the site is down or thereâs another security problem.
(Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location.
The consequences of this development for the world at large are staggering: 1  A typical family of four is expected to have 50 connected devices in 2022, double the number of 2017. 2  By the same year, 30 billion such devices are to expected to exist. 3  As a consequence, the Internet of Things will become a trillion industry.
The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data.
Security experts view Internet of things as a threat to the traditional Internet. Some argue that market incentive to secure IoT devices is insufficient and increased governmental regulation is necessary to make the Internet of things secure. The overall understanding of IoT is essential for basic user security.
To a large extent, the future of the Internet of things will not be possible without the support of IPv6; and consequently the global adoption of IPv6 in the coming years will be critical for the successful development of the IoT in the future.
In this context, three main areas are being covered in literature: 1  The integration of the internet with building energy management systems in order to create energy efficient and IOT driven âsmart buildingsâ. 2  The possible means of real-time monitoring for reducing energy consumption and monitoring occupant behaviors.

A burning sensation is a type of pain thatâs distinct from dull, stabbing, or aching pain. A burning pain is often related to nerve problems. However, there are many other possible causes. Injuries, infections, and autoimmune disorders have the potential to trigger nerve pain, and in some cases cause nerve damage.

Daftydil wrote: For a couple of weeks I have had a complete burning sensation in my right hand. As I have somesort of anxiety disorder I thought it was that and my imagination overacting. Today the pain is unbearable and had to sit with ice in my hand. It looks like a burn- yet I know for sure that I have not burnt my hand.
My hands feel like they are being slow roasted over a fire. They aren't hot to the touch, but they are burning, especially in the palm area and where my finger joints are. Sometimes they also tingle, but the burning sensation is the strongest by far. There is no rash and my hands are not swollen.
I tried washing my hands in Dawn diswashing liquid...nothing I put vinegar on them..only short term relief. I finally just put ice in a ziploc bag and held it till my hands were numb. It took about 8-10 hours for the burning to quit and this was a teeny tiny hab about the size of a nickle. I am buying plastic gloves today when I go to town. Thanks again everyone.
What you can do now. Many conditions that cause a burning sensation have no cure, but treatments can make a big difference in reducing the pain and any other symptoms. You should see your doctor so you can receive a diagnosis and treatment for the problem that may be causing your burning sensation.
If you are going to do a lot of chili's your hands can start burning even if you are wearing gloves. I where double gloves not if I have a lot. If you are wearing gloves even if your hands aren't burning you can still have some on your hands when you take off the gloves.
Using gloves for this trick is best, and it's also important to have a bucket of water on hand, in case you need to put out fire. Find a suitable flameproof surface on which to work. You need to go outside to do this trick, preferably on a patch of concrete far away from anything flammable. The flatter, the better.

Right now, he has 6oz. of formula every 3 hours. A: Whatever feeding schedule gets the most food into your baby with the least amount of hassles is the right one for you and your baby. Remember, feeding your baby is a social interaction, not just delivery of food.
Lastly, teeth appear around six months. So, if your baby is not happy about solids at four months, wait a month or two and try again. All his nutritional needs can be met by the infant formula (figure approximately two ounces of formula per pound of baby's weight).
1- Make a bottle of formula (6 ounces). Take one ounce from bottle and add to one tablespoon of single grain rice cereal in a bowl. Use a soft ended spoon to mix and feed (let baby taste it at first).Make sure he is sitting up with you or in a chair. 2- Feed this cereal mix 1x per day at evening not close to bed. Do this for five days.
Watch for any reactions. 4- After that, feed 2 tablespoons of single grain oatmeal + 1 1/2 ounces of formula once a day. ALSO, continue feeding rice cereal + formula once a day... so he will be eating solids two times a day. I usually did one time mid morning and the second at night to space it out. 5- Feed with the oatmeal (+ rice cereal for 2nd feeding) for 5 days.
1. Begin with rice cereal on days 1,2 and 3, offering it twice daily at breakfast and dinnertime. Rice cereal can be mixed with water or milk(breast or formula) to make a thin oatmeal like consistency. The infant should be offered a rubberized spoon. During these first three days, offer 3-4 tablespoons at a time but be flexible. Some infants will be very hungry and want more- that's OK.
Q. My 5-month-old baby has been eating four times a day. She totals 32oz of formula and one scoop of rice with each meal. She also has 1TBS of carrots during two of those feedings.
The term feeding schedule varies greatly according to the temperament of your baby and the time management of the caregiver. There is some merit to putting baby on a predictable feeding schedule. Offer solids at the time of the day when your baby seems the hungriest and you have the most time. Mornings are usually the time when most formula-fed babies eat the most.
Once you get up to 3-4 tablespoons of cereal and a fruit and vegetable at one meal, then it is usually time to introduce another meal during the day, with the goal of 3 regular meals by the time your baby is about 7-8 months old.
Infants who are very premature(Less than 35 weeks) may not be ready for solids at age 4 months and may be more ready at 5 or 6 months of age depending on their degree of prematurity and other circumstances.
We prefer parents to use the infant's hunger cues as a guide to how much to feed, since the infant's appetite will vary from meal to meal. A rough estimate is as follows: Age 4 mon-offer 2-4 total ounces per feed, Age 5 mon-offer 4-8 ounces total per meal, Age 6 mon-offer 6-12 ounces total per meal.

When she walked on stage in front of 500,000 people at Woodstock 40 years ago, she was an unknown 19-year-old folk singer. She sang Beautiful People to the beautiful people, as the hippies of the time were called. 'I was just about as unworldly as a girl could be,' she recalls now.
Forty far-out facts you never knew about Woodstock. Woodstock, the most famous music festival in rock 'n' roll history, took place 40 years ago on August 15-18, 1969. To celebrate, here are 40 things you didn't know about it...
The Woodstock Music & Art Fairâinformally, the Woodstock Festival or simply Woodstockâwas a music festival attracting an audience of over 400,000 people, scheduled over three days on a dairy farm in New York state from August 15 to 17, 1969, but ultimately ran four days long, ending August 18, 1969.
WOODSTOCK BANDS & PERFORMERS: THE PLAYLIST LINEUP. This page is dedicated to the original Woodstock 1969 playlist of bands. The Woodstock lineup is one of the most legendary in history. The hottest and most diverse collection of bands of 1969 gathered here and created a playlist that would forever shape music to come.
(It actually took place in Bethel, which is about an hour and a half southwest, close to Narrowsburg.) That didnât stop Woodstock from becoming a bohemian destination though; for many years, the streets were lined in touristy gift stores and head shops.
Kornfeld and Lang agreed to the new plan, and Woodstock Ventures was formed in January 1969. The company offices were located in an oddly decorated floor of 47 West 57th Street in Manhattan. Burt Cohen, and his design group, Curtain Call Productions, oversaw the psychedelic transformation of the office.
Woodstock was initiated through the efforts of Michael Lang, John Roberts, Joel Rosenman, and Artie Kornfeld. Roberts and Rosenman financed the project. Lang had some experience as a promoter, having co-organized a small festival on the East Coast the prior year, the Miami Pop Festival, where an estimated 25,000 people attended the two-day event.
For many, the word Woodstock conjures up images of tie dye, hippies, and free love at the 3-day outdoor music festivalâ¦ that did not actually take place here.

The process of moving you to acceptance is easy to describe and to understand. However, it can be a challenge to experience acceptance. In order to experience acceptance, we need to change our attitude. In order to change our attitude, we need to change our altitude. Moving out of judgment to acceptance requires an attitude of gratitude.
Acceptance in human psychology is a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a negative or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it or protest it. The concept is close in meaning to 'acquiescence', derived from the Latin 'acquiÄscere' (to find rest in).
An Unconditional Acceptance of what is just as choosing to resist what is are nothing more than choices that we ourselves have been provided the right as well as the ability to make which determine what The Flow delivers to us individually. The Flow never rests...the process of attraction never fails. It's the nature of the Universe to multiply and consistently supply an abundance of whatever we choose for ourselves. In fact, faith and abundance is all there is. The Power of Acceptance is far more than a feel good philosophy.
The term acceptance is a noun with three different meanings. The first is the act of taking or receiving something offered. For example, if someone gives a gift and another receives it, then they have accepted the gift; therefore, having acceptance.
One of the first responsibilities of the executive sponsor is to select the production acceptance process owner. The process owner should be a member of the infrastructure organization since most of the ongoing activities of operating and supporting a new production application fall within this group.
One of the ï¬rst responsibilities of the executive sponsor is to select the. production acceptance process owner. The process owner should be a. member of the infrastructure organization since most of the ongoing. activities of operating and supporting a new production application fall.
When a production acceptance process is designed and implemented, particularly in environments that have never had one, there is normally a major change in the manner in which application systems are deployed.
This chapter. deï¬nes the process of production acceptance and describes many of the. beneï¬ts this process provides to a variety of groups both inside and out-. side of IT. The middle sections of this chapter discuss each of the 14. steps required to design and implement an effective production accept-. ance process.
Consciously choosing The Power of Acceptance enables and. empowers you to go with rather than against The Flow. The Power of Acceptance and your willingness to consciously activate it's power in every aspect of your life is the often overlooked key to experiencing a quality of life that surpasses common human logic.
The function of systems management that addresses this challenge is production acceptance. Production Acceptance: Production acceptance is a methodology used to consistently and successfully deploy application systems into a production environment regardless of platform.

Bush administration, to replace FBI Director Robert Mueller III, whose already extended 10-year term expires in September.
It's worth noting that, if confirmed as FBI director, Comey will be essentially untouchable by the White House, says Ambinder at The Week. His instincts to stand up to presidents trying to expand their power may â may â mean that Comey will rein in the excesses of FBI surveillance authority..

For instance, some calcium supplements may also contain vitamin D or magnesium. Check the ingredient list to see which form of calcium your calcium supplement is and what other nutrients it may contain. This information is important if you have any health or dietary concerns.
Calcium is essential for strong bones and teeth, and it's also necessary for your nerves to function and your muscles to contract and relax properly. You get that calcium from the foods you eat. While there are many non-dairy foods that are rich in calcium, dairy is such an excellent source of calcium that it qualifies as a food group. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, you need about three servings of dairy every day. The downside of dairy is that it can be high in saturated fat.
1 To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.  Adult women under 30 need 310 milligrams a day, while women over 30 need 320 milligrams. Men need 400 milligrams before 30 and 420 milligrams after 30.
1 Many dairy products, such as butter, cheese, and milk have vitamin D. Fortified cereals and fish are also good sources of this vitamin.  For adults under 70 years of age, 600 international units of vitamin D per day is sufficient. Adults over 70 should consume 800 international units.
More isn't always better: Too much calcium has risks. Dietary calcium is generally safe, but more isn't necessarily better, and excessive calcium doesn't provide extra bone protection. If you take calcium supplements and eat calcium-fortified foods, you may be getting more calcium than you realize.
Make sure you are getting enough magnesium in your daily diet to help absorb the calcium supplements you're taking. To increase your magnesium, eat whole grains, vegetables such as summer squash, green beans, broccoli, cucumbers, and spinach, and nuts and seeds.
Calcium supplements aren't for everyone. For instance, if you have a health condition that causes excess calcium in your bloodstream (hypercalcemia), you should avoid calcium supplements. It's not definitive, but there may be a link between calcium supplements and heart disease.
To calculate the amount of calcium in your diet, you need to keep track of your food using a food journal. Basically, you write down everything you eat in a day, including the serving size. Then you can calculate the amount of calcium in the foods you ate. For instance, a cup of yogurt has 415 milligrams of calcium.
You can use more yogurt (and more calcium) to thicken your smoothie bowl, too. Smoothie bowls are often made with fresh berries -- not only for good nutrition but also for the gorgeous colors. Make your smoothie bowl a work or art by topping it with nuts, seeds, granola and dried or fresh fruit.
Even if you eat a healthy, balanced diet, you may find it difficult to get enough calcium if you: 1  Follow a vegan diet. 2  Have lactose intolerance and limit dairy products.  Consume large amounts of protein or sodium, which can cause your body to excrete more calcium.
Shredding important documents like your MSN, Explanation of Benefits (EOB), other statements, and bills will ensure that thieves cannot get their hands on this sensitive information. â¢ Reviewing your MSN is one of the best ways that you can help detect potential errors and fraud.
It is important to immediately open and read your MSN to make sure that you have received all of the services listed. â¢ Use the Personal Health Care Journal, which you can obtain from your local SMP, to keep a record of medical visits, tests, receipts for services, and equipment you have received.
Youâll get your MSN every 3 months if you get any services or medical supplies during that 3-month period. If you donât get any services or medical supplies during that 3-month period you wonât get an MSN for that particular 3-month period.
â¢ Review your MSN and compare it to your receipts, records and Personal Health Care Journal. If you notice any mistakes, or have questions, report them immediately! Call your provider or health plan with your questions. If you still have unanswered questions, call your local SMP.
Explaining the Medicare Summary Notice. When you are enrolled in Medicare, and you receive health services, the health care provider directly bills Medicare. The Medicare program pays your health care provider for her services. You then receive a Medicare Summary Notice (MSN), describing the services and cost of service. The MSN is a not a bill to you, but you should spend some time reviewing the information, nonetheless.
â¢ Protecting your personal information is the first line of defense against fraud. Although you should save your Medicare Summary Notices and related statements, make sure to shred them when they are no longer useful.
1 If you paid a bill before you got your notice, compare your MSN with the bill to make sure you paid the right amount for your services. 2  If an item or service is denied, call your doctorâs or other health care provider's office to make sure they submitted the correct information. 3  If not, the office may resubmit.
The Medicare Summary Notice contains a summary of your benefits for Medicare, including Part A, Part B and Part C. In mid-2013, the federal government redesigned the Medicare Summary Notice. Based on the results of a study of Medicare recipients, several changes were made that make the MSN easier to read and understand.
It's not a bill. Itâs a notice that people with Original Medicare get in the mail every 3 months for their Medicare Part A and Part B-covered services.
Medicare Summary Notice. A notice sent to a patient by Medicare showing all the services or supplies that providers and suppliers billed to Medicare during the prior 3-month period, what Medicare paid, and what the patient owes the provider.

Traction, also known as stretch injury, is one of the mechanisms that cause brachial plexus injury. The nerves of the brachial plexus are damaged due to the forced pull by the widening of the shoulder and neck. This is a closer look at the traction mechanism at the cervical spine.
Each of the five nerves in the brachial plexus has a specific function, such as powering muscles or carrying sensory information from the hand to the brain. Because each nerve has a function, the location of the nerve injury within the plexus is important for predicting outcomes and for planning treatment.
Brachial Plexus Injuries. The brachial plexus is a network of intertwined nerves that control movement and sensation in the arm and hand. A traumatic brachial plexus injury involves sudden damage to these nerves, and may cause weakness, loss of feeling, or loss of movement in the shoulder, arm, or hand.
Brachial Plexus: What Is It? The brachial plexus is made up of five nerves, which are fibers that carry electrical messages from the brain to the muscles. The brachial plexus nerves start in the spinal cord and branch out from the neck to the muscles and tissues down the arms. These nerves provide movement and feeling to the shoulders, arms, and hands.

Marine Corps Deployments. The Marine Corps is a rapid deployment force that can quickly be sent where needed. To carry out its deployment mission, the Marine Corps and the Navy normally operate in conjunction with each other as part of amphibious or air-ground task forces.
Marine Deployment Length. Marine Corps units operating on their own or with Navy units deploy under a unit deployment schedule. Generally, the Marine Corps tries to adhere to a standard six-month deployment schedule for purposes of training and operational readiness.
The military arm of the nation's maritime fleet, the U.S. Navy, helps to patrol the world's oceans in order to keep them safe. With more than 285 ships, including 11 super aircraft carriers, the U.S. Navy is in a constant state of deployment.
The plan has the flexibility to increase some deployments to seven months compared with the normal six-month assignments, the Navy said this week. Efforts will be made to keep deployments to six months, officials said, and if any cruise must last beyond seven months, the Navy's top admiral must be asked for permission. Although the policy assures sailors as much time at home as on deployment, there could be exceptions.
Both the Navy and Marine Corps deploy on a regular basis. Marine Corps deployments typically occur as part of the Fleet Marine Force, with units operating from Navy ships. Marine Corps deployments involve infantry and other elements deploying to forward combat areas on land, and they can last for some time.
Navy Deployments. Typically, a Navy deployment consists of several ships traveling together to and from specific regions. Depending on the mission, a deployed Navy group of ships features embarked Marine Corps infantry and aircraft as well as submarines and Navy aircraft carriers.
While at sea during such exercises and deployments, the pace of operations for the U.S. Navy tends to be high. During a U.S. Navy joint military exercise, sailors and officers often work long hours training and drilling alongside U.S. allies.
The average Army deployment rate can range from 12 months deployed, followed by 12 months at home station assignment, to 12 months deployed, 24 months at home.
Soldiers on active duty in the Army deploy more than any other branch, with the possible exception of the Navy (although most Navy deployments are on ships at sea). How often you deploy depends on whether the U.S. is involved in any ongoing conflicts. Deployment is also heavily determined by your Army job.
NORFOLK -- The Navy is changing its deployment policy for the first time in 22 years, telling sailors they could face longer periods at sea because of the demands of war. However, the policy reaffirms the Navy's promise that once they return home, they can spend an equal amount of time there before the next deployment.

Rogers and Hammerstein II settled on television director and actor Yul Brynner. In rehearsals, at Yul Brynner's first meeting with costume designer Irene Sharaff, Yul Brynner had only a fringe of curly hair. Yul Brynner asked Sharaff what he was to do about it.When Sharaff told him to shave it, Brynner was horror-struck, refused, convinced he would look terrible.rynner came to dominate his role and the musical, starring in a four-year national tour culminating in his last performance, a special Sunday night show, on June 30, 1985, in honor of Yul Brynner and his 4,625th performance of the role.

1 Hat Damage: In Speedy Gonzales, Speedy is working as a living target in a shooting gallery when he gets a bullet through his hat.  Hero Antagonist: Like a lot of other Looney Tunes protagonists, he flip flopped with this, a lot of shorts giving the main focus to the blundering of foes such as Sylvester or Daffy.
Speedy Gonzales (1955) Approved | 7min | Animation, Family, Short | 17 September 1955 (USA) Starving Mexican mice want access to a cheese factory guarded by Sylvester Cat and send for Speedy Gonzales, the fastest mouse in all Mexico, to breeze past Sylvester and obtain the cheese ... See full summary Â».
Speedy Gonzales, the beloved Looney Tunes mouse who can outrun the fastest of cats and whose Arriba! Arriba! Andale! Andale! cry was a Saturday morning staple for kids growing up in the 1960s, is being eyed as an animated feature at Warner Bros. with Mexicoâs own beloved filmmaker/actor Eugenio Derbez voicing the mouse. âIn Mexico we grew up watching Speedy Gonzales,â Derbez told Deadline. âHe was like a superhero to us, or maybe more like a revolutionario like Simon Bolivar or Pancho Villa. He watched out for the little people but with a lot of bravado and a weakness for the ladies.
Speedy Gonzales started out as a character in another cartoon before animators Friz Freleng and Hawley Pratt introduced him in an animated short of his own in 1955. Then, the legendary Mel Blanc voiced the mouse.
Speedy Gonzales is a recurring character of the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies franchises, starring in 46 short cartoons. He is a Mexican mouse endowed with Super Speed.

No. Speedy Gonzales has always been very popular in Mexico, and in much of the Hispanic world. But in the late 1990s, Warnerâs Cartoon Network virtually banished him from its schedules, partly because of worries that he was a racist stereotype.
Appearance: White smock, red kerchief, gigantic sombrero, cheeky grin, at least from his second film onwards. Just remind me of it? Called simply Speedy Gonzales, it showed him and his friends trying to cross the US border to steal cheese that was being guarded by Sylvester the Cat. Good old Speedy! Heâs one of my all-time favourite pieces of 20th-century intellectual property. In that case, youâll be pleased to know that heâs coming back.

After eating, peristalsis in the ileum forces chyme into the cecum. When the cecum is distended with chyme, contractions of the ileocecal sphincter strengthen. Once chyme enters the cecum, colon movements begin. Mechanical digestion in the large intestine includes a combination of three types of movements.
The ileum is the last section of the small intestine. Like the jejunum, it is also around 10 feet long and its pH lies between 7 and 8. The bacterial density here is also 10 4 -10 7 CFU/mL and has a microbe community similar to that of the colon.

Cloud computing has been a hugely disruptive technology in the business world, displacing many resources that would conventionally have been located in-house or provided as a traditionally hosted service.
AOL: Three Decades of Turmoil. Introduction. AOL has gone from fame and glory to hype to trying everything possible simply to survive. Started in 1983 as âQuantum Computerâ (Agamawi, 2012), later renamed America Online, the company went public on the NASDAQ in 1992 and proceeded to grow 50,000% in just two yearâs time.
In January 2001 AOL merged with what was widely considered a conservative media company called Time Warner, itself having been built largely through mergers and acquisitions. At the time of the merger, Time Warner was valued at $90 billion, compared to AOLâs $175 billion.
The development of Western technology . One of the most fascinating problems of technological change is the rise and continuing development of Western âindustrialâ technology, and it has attracted a corresponding amount of attention.
Finally, a firm×³s culture has also been identified as a critical precondition for the emergence of disruptive innovation. Firm culture refers to a core set of attitudes and practices that are shared by the members of the firm (Detert et al., 2000; Martin, 2002 ; Schultz and Hatch, 1996).
Major changes in human life have been associated with major technological changes, such as the âfood-producing revolution,â the âurban revolution,â and the âindustrial revolutionâ and its modern continuations; even the evolution of biologically modern man has been influenced by innovations in tool using.
Much less attention has been paid to the role of innovation processes, including their goals and design, in promoting disruptive innovation. In this paper we aim to begin to fill this gap by better understanding how new innovation processes can act as antecedents for disruptive innovation.

A disruptive technology is one that displaces an established technology and shakes up the industry or a ground-breaking product that creates a completely new industry. Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen coined the term disruptive technology. In his 1997 best-selling book, The Innovator's Dilemma, Christensen separates new technology into two categories: sustaining and disruptive.
There are two places where the bicep muscle connects: the shoulder and the elbow. In your shoulder, tendons connect your bicep into the shoulder joint. In your elbow, tendons keep the muscle attached to your lower arm. We most often see bicep injuries at the connection point with your shoulder. Strains or tears can develop in the ligaments.
Rotator cuff. A combination of muscles and tendons keeps your arm centered in your shoulder socket. These tissues are called the rotator cuff. They cover the head of your upper arm bone and attach it to your shoulder blade. Biceps tendons. The biceps muscle is in the front of your upper arm.
10 Possible Causes of Arm Pain. Featured, Your Health. Sources of arm pain are numerous, affecting the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones of the arm, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, and fingers. If youâre experiencing a strange pain, tenderness, or numbness in your arm, and you donât know why, consider the following 10 common causes of arm painâ¦.
Left shoulder pain can be extremely concerning, especially when the cause is unknown. The pain may occur when you breathe deeply, making it very difficult to function throughout the day. Left shoulder pain may be the result of normal activities of daily living to serious health conditions.
Years of shoulder wear and tear can cause the biceps tendon to become inflamed. Examination of the tissues in these cases commonly shows signs of degeneration. Degeneration in a tendon causes a loss of the normal arrangement of the collagen fibers that join together to form the tendon.
An injury to the shoulder or surrounding region can cause pain and discomfort. Injury related left shoulder pain is usually quite obvious to a person, particularly if it manifests itself right after the accident that caused the injury. In some cases the pain may not develop immediately after an injury.
Persistent pain and weakness may be a sign of a serious strain of the biceps that may also involve tearing of the attachment of the tendon inside the shoulder joint. Such serious injury may require surgery. If persistent pain and weakness is experienced the injury should be re-evaluated by a surgeon.
Rotator cuff/bicep tendinosis is diagnosed by eliciting pain or weakness with stress testing of the rotator cuff muscles. There are two common tests used for diagnosis of impingement: The Neerâs Test and the Hawkinsâ Test. The Neer's test elicits pain with passive abduction of the shoulder to 180 degrees.
Biceps Tendinitis. Biceps tendinitis is an inflammation or irritation of the upper biceps tendon. Also called the long head of the biceps tendon, this strong, cord-like structure connects the biceps muscle to the bones in the shoulder. Pain in the front of the shoulder and weakness are common symptoms of biceps tendinitis.
Article Sections. Patients with acute brachial plexus neuritis are often misdiagnosed as having cervical radiculopathy. Acute brachial plexus neuritis is an uncommon disorder characterized by severe shoulder and upper arm pain followed by marked upper arm weakness. The temporal profile of pain preceding weakness is important in establishing a prompt diagnosis and differentiating acute brachial plexus neuritis from cervical radiculopathy.

You will probably be surprised to find that your per-mile costs to fuel cars are cheaper with electric cars than with gas cars. Calculating your per-mile cost for gas cars is pretty simple, as long as you know your average cost for a gallon of gasoline, your typical fuel economy and the number of miles you drive. For example, if your car gets 25 mpg and gas is $4 per gallon, it will cost you 16 cents per mile in gasoline.
About Gas Mileage Savings Calculator: Car Cost vs. Fuel Savings. You would like to save money on gas so you're considering trading in your gas guzzler for a more fuel efficient car. This calculator shows how long will it take before you pay off the balance of a vehicle purchase and really begin saving money. Based on the EPA's MPG data and assuming 45% highway driving and 55% city driving.
The new label assigns each vehicle a rating from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) for fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions (i.e., how much carbon dioxide the vehicleâs tailpipe emits each mile), as shown below. Consumers may note that higher fuel economy is associated with a better GHG emissions profile.
Itâs that simple. We take the average distance that a gasoline-powered vehicle can drive on a gallon of gas (28.2 miles for comparable 2012 model year cars), and then calculate how much it would cost to drive the average EV that same distance.
Fuel consumption rate. Kilowatt-hours is an energy unit for electricity. This value tells you how many kilowatt-hours the vehicle would use to travel 100 miles. Like gallons per 100 miles, this kilowatt-hours per 100 miles value relates directly to the amount of electricity used, and thus to cost.
The fuel savings, in gallons, for a vehicle that gets 10 MPG versus a vehicle that gets 15 MPG is about 33 gallons (assuming 1,000 miles). On the other hand, the fuel savings in gallons - for the same five MPG fuel economy jump - for a 30 MPG versus a 35 MPG vehicle is only about five gallons.
*Gas driving costs are based on current prices of $2.31/gallon and assume a 25m/gallon gas mileage. Average 2013 gas prices were $3.58/gallon (Energy Information Administration). EV driving costs are based on 35 kwh/100 miles and standard residential rates.
The price of gasoline is posted at every corner gas station, but what about the cost of driving on electricity? The Department of Energyâs eGallon provides a quick and simple answer to this question and allows electric vehicle (EV) drivers to see how much they can save on fuel by using electricity instead of gasoline.
Calculate the savings from trading in your gas guzzler. You would like to save money on gas so you're considering trading in your gas guzzler for a more fuel efficient car. This calculator shows how long will it take before you pay off the balance of a vehicle purchase and really begin saving money.
Calculating your electricity cost is a bit more complicated. First, visit the automaker's website for the electric car to get the specifics on the projected charging times for the type of charging system you intend to use. Then, you'll need to use your electric company's kilowatt-hour rates.
Morphine, sold under many trade names, is a pain medication of the opiate type. It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to decrease the feeling of pain. It can be used for both acute pain and chronic pain. Morphine is also frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction and during labour.It can be administered orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally.orphine is a precursor in the manufacture in a large number of opioids such as dihydromorphine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and oxycodone as well as codeine, which itself has a large family of semi-synthetic derivatives.
Morphine is part of a class of drugs called opiate (narcotic) analgesics, or opioid agonists, which block the transmission of pain signals to the brain by binding to nervous system proteins called opioid receptors.Morphine is also sometimes prescribed off label to treat pain in hospitalized children.: Morphine is a medication that is used for pain management and is in the class of medications called opioid narcotics. Opioids act by attaching to specific proteins called opioid receptors, which are found in the brain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract.

The term large-ion lithophile element (or LILE) is frequently used, but poorly defined in the geochemical literature. Some authors use LILE as a synonym for incompatible (or hygromagmatophile) trace elements (e.g.), whereas others use LILE to refer to a specific subset of incompatible trace elements characterized by small charge to ionic radius ratio (or low field strength elements; ). relative to more compatible trace elements. The LILE are strongly enriched in the upper continental crust (. ), but occur in lower concentrations in the deep continental crust due to its overall more mafic character and selective loss of some LILE during high-grade metamorphism (see Metamorphism).

Lithophile elements are those that remain on or close to the surface because they combine readily with oxygen, forming compounds that do not sink into the core.anganese, iron and molybdenum do form strong bonds with oxygen but in the free state (as they existed on the primitive earth when free oxygen did not exist) can mix so easily with iron that they do not concentrate in the siliceous crust as do true lithophile elements.
In addition to NiS collection fire assay for a five element PGM suite, the samples will undergo research quality analyses for a wide range of elements, including the large ion. , the rare earth elements, high field strength elements, sulphur and selenium.hey include 55 elements of the periodic system: O, Si, Al, Ti, B, C, all the alkali and alkaline-earth metals, the halogens, and many of the rare elements.
Their strong affinity for oxygen causes lithophile elements to associate very strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that thus float to the crust. The more soluble minerals formed by the alkali metals tend to concentrate in seawater or extremely arid regions where they can crystallise.anganese, iron and molybdenum do form strong bonds with oxygen but in the free state (as they existed on the primitive earth when free oxygen did not exist) can mix so easily with iron that they do not concentrate in the siliceous crust as do true lithophile elements.
Most lithophile elements form very stable ions with an electron configuration of a noble gas (sometimes with additional f-electrons). The few that do not, such as silicon, phosphorus and boron, form extremely strong covalent bonds with oxygen â often involving pi bonding.anganese, iron and molybdenum do form strong bonds with oxygen but in the free state (as they existed on the primitive earth when free oxygen did not exist) can mix so easily with iron that they do not concentrate in the siliceous crust as do true lithophile elements.

Because of the confusion in the literature regarding usage of LILE, it is recommended that the term be restricted to lithophile trace elements having small charge to ionic radius ratios and which also have ionic radii greater than those of Ca 2+ and Na 1+ , the largest cations common to rock forming minerals. relative to more compatible trace elements. The LILE are strongly enriched in the upper continental crust (. ), but occur in lower concentrations in the deep continental crust due to its overall more mafic character and selective loss of some LILE during high-grade metamorphism (see Metamorphism).

Poetic Form: Sonnet. read poems by this poet. William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-on-Avon. The son of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden, he was probably educated at the King Edward IV Grammar School in Stratford, where he learned Latin and a little Greek and read the Roman dramatists. At eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman seven or eight years his senior. Together they raised two daughters: Susanna, who was born in 1583, and Judith (whose twin brother died in boyhood), born in 1585. Little is known about Shakespeare's activities between 1585 and 1592.
He died one month later, on April 23, 1616. To the world, he left a lasting legacy in the form of 38 plays, 154 sonnets, and two narrative poems. When William Shakespeare died in his birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon, he was recognized as one of the greatest English playwrights of his era.
Therefore, unlike his fellow playwright Christopher Marlowe, he did not attend university. Rather, in 1582 at age 18, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior and three months pregnant. Their first child, Susanna, was born in 1583, and twins, Hamnet and Judith, came in 1585.
Thousands of people every year continue to follow this tradition and visit Shakespeareâs Birthplace â and the house remains one of Stratford-upon-Avonâs busiest attractions.
He drew up his will in January of 1616, which included his famous bequest to his wife of his second best bed.. He died on April 23, 1616, and was buried two days later at Stratford Church.
The Life of William Shakespeare (1564â1616). Within the class system of Elizabethan England, William Shakespeare did not seem destined for greatness. He was not born into a family of nobility or significant wealth.
Yet in spite of these limitations, Shakespeare is now the most performed and read playwright in the world. Born to John Shakespeare, a glovemaker and tradesman, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent farmer, William Shakespeare was baptized on April 26, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon.
The money was raised successfully and the house was in the safe hands of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust by 1847. Today, the house has been converted into a museum and is open to the public all year round.
Shakespeare's Birth. The baptismal register of the Holy Trinity parish church, in Stratford, shows the following entry for April 26, 1564: Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakespeare.
Shakespeare was born in 1564 into a prosperous family in Stratford-upon-Avon, UK. Although there is no record of his birth, it is presumed that Shakespeare was born on 23 April because he was entered into the baptism register of Holy Trinity Church shortly after.

It sucks in smoke   Smoke is made up of mostly solid substances dispersed in a gas. The electrostatic smoke precipitator generates static electricity, this then gives the s â¦ olid particles passing through them a negative charge.
Air is drawn into the unit to capture particles. The airborne particles pass through an electrostatic field and receive an ionized charge. The charged particles move into a collector section where each alternate plate is charged with the same polarity as the particles. This drives the particles to the second set of plates of an opposite charge to attract and collect the particles. The cleaned air is then returned to the plant or building.
We use DC voltages in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) because it is necessary to induce a charge on the particulates, and then attract them to a plate by the use of an opp â¦ osite charge. An AC source would be changing constantly.
Electrostatic Precipitator Facts. 1  Electrostatic Precipitators use up to 50% less energy than equivalently sized media air cleaners. 2  Unlike media air cleaners and cartridge collectors that can lose up to 50% of its airflow with a dirty filter, electrostatic precipitators see an airflow drop of less than 5% when dirty.
Answer by Ftrip. Confidence votes 14. With a high voltage applied to the discharge electrodes a strong electrical field is created between the electrodes and the flue gas is ionised, plus-ions migrate to the negative electrode and minus-ions migrate to the ground electrode.
Unlike media air cleaners that use replaceable filters that plug up when dirty, electrostatic precipitators contain permanent cells that can be washed, either manually or with an included automatic wash system. These permanent cells do not require added static pressure when they get dirty to pull air through them.
Electrostatic Precipitators for Power Plants. Many countries around the world, including our own, depend on coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity. A natural result from the burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, is the emission of flyash. Ash is mineral matter present in the fuel.
Electrostatic precipitators are not only used in utility applications but also other industries (for other exhaust gas particles) such as cement (dust), pulp & paper (salt cake & lime dust), petrochemicals (sulfuric acid mist), and steel (dust & fumes).
These fabric filters are inherently large structures resulting in a large pressure drop, which reduces the plant efficiency. Electrostatic precipitators have collection efficiency of 99%, but do not work well for flyash with a high electrical resistivity (as commonly results from combustion of low-sulfur coal). In addition, the designer must avoid allowing unburned gas to enter the electrostatic precipitator since the gas could be ignited.
Electrostatic spray painting works because when the paint particles are released from the spray gun they have a negative charge and since your item is positively charged the n â¦ egative particles are attracted to it.

In 2000, Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, was fined $2.5 million for blocking and delaying phone calls from consumers trying to get information about their credit. In 2003, the FTC took Equifax to court for the same reason and settled its lawsuit with the company for a fine of $250,000.

While I personally enjoy those kinds of features, for me it is more about the systems employed in actually making the games. As the longest running user of the RPG Maker software on our team (dating back to the untranslated RPG Maker 95 by ASCII Corporation), I have seen the series change a great deal over the years.
Well fellow believers the time has come. RPG maker is here! There is much rejoicing and much pain and suffering. Let me say this right off the bat. You will need a lot of time to make a game with RPG maker. That means you will nead about 1-2 months if you hope to create a game. But that does not involve the time neaded to understand how to use this thing.

Wine is 85 to 90 percent water, so it freezes at about 20 F (-6.7 C) -- the water freezes first at 32 F (zero C) and then the alcohol after that [source: Wine Spectator ]. It'll be slushy for a while before it becomes solid. A word to the wise: Don't freeze wine in the bottle.
1 The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures. 2  The frozen material, while always poorer in alcohol than the (increasingly rich) liquid, becomes progressively richer in alcohol.
1 Freezing in this scenario begins at a temperature significantly below 0 Â°C. 2  The first material to freeze is not the water, but a dilute solution of alcohol in water. 3  The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures.
Mendeleev, the chemist who devised the periodic table, standardized the amount of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) in vodka when he was the Director of the Russian Bureau of Standards. Russian vodka is 40% ethanol and 60% water by volume (80 proof). Vodka from other countries may range from 35% to 50% ethanol by volume.
The best-known freeze-distilled beverages are applejack and ice beer. Ice wine is the result of a similar process, but in this case, the freezing happens before the fermentation, and thus it is sugar, not alcohol, that gets concentrated. For an in depth discussion of the physics and chemistry, see eutectic point.
A bottle of 190-proof Everclear has a freezing point of -173.2 F (-114 C), so it would come out well-chilled but still 100 percent liquid after a day in the freezer [source: Sauce ]. Eighty-proof vodka freezes at -16.5 F (-27 C), so it'd also survive unfrozen [source: Alcoholic Science ].
The freezing point depends on the spirit's proof, or alcoholic concentration, which is is double its alcohol percentage. Vodka is usually about 80 proof, or 40 percent alcohol. Wine is usually around 28 proof, and grain alcohol is 190 proof -- pretty darn close to pure alcohol [source: Real Simple ].
This phenomenon is known as freezing point depression. It is possible to freeze vodka, but not in a typical home freezer. The freezing point of 80 proof vodka is -26.95Â° C or -16.51Â° F, while the temperature of most home freezers is around -17Â° C. By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D.
1 The first material to freeze is not the water, but a dilute solution of alcohol in water. 2  The liquid left behind is richer in alcohol, and as a consequence, further freezing would take place at progressively lower temperatures.
Why doesn't vodka freeze when you put it in the freezer? The answer to the question has to do with the chemical composition of vodka and a phenomenon known as freezing point depression.

10 Most Outrageous Things Benjamin Franklin Ever Did. Some call him âThe Newton of Electricity,â and others call him âThe First American.â Whatever the nickname, we can all agree Benjamin Franklin was one of a kind. After all, he invented his own alphabet, was a chess master, and thereâs even a psychological effect bearing his name.
Hereâs what is known about Franklinâs formal education: 1  Franklinâs father sent Benjamin to the Boston Latin School at age eight. This public school designed to provide education in the humanities to all boys regardless of their social class.
Surprisingly, although Benjamin Franklin was an accomplished inventor, scientist, writer, philosopher, statesmen, diplomat, and abolitionist, he did not actually graduate from the finest institutions of higher learning. Benjamin Franklinâs greatest education came not from any type of formal school but instead from his own life and experience.
The Franklin Institute is located in Center City Philadelphia, at the intersection of 20th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Step-by-Step Directions. Members enjoy free admission, discounted exhibition tickets and more.
NFL Draft In Philadelphia. The 2017 NFL Draft is coming to Philadelphia this April 27-29. With activities and events spanning the Parkway, The Franklin Institute can be an exciting part of your NFL Draft experience.

Benjamin Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers and a genius. He was the colonies' ambassador to France and convinced the French government to fight alongside the Americans â¦against the British. He published pro-American books and a newspaper.
Quick Answer. Ben Franklin had many hobbies, including swimming, reading and conducting scientific experiments. His fascination with electricity led to his invention of the lightning rod, which proved to be a great safety device that protected homes from catching fire in lightning storms. Continue Reading.
Benjamin Franklin lived his life in the spirit of a renaissance man: he was deeply interested in the world around him, and he excelled in several widely differing fields of human endeavor. He had a profound effect on our understanding of electricity and shaped the language we use when we talk about it, even today.
How do I get negative credit expunged from my credit report? I have paid off some of the creditor through collection agencies but I was told that it will be at least 10 years for it to be off my credit record. I hear there are some credit repair companies out there.
To make a dispute online, you must have recently ordered a copy of your credit report. You can submit a dispute with the credit bureau who provided the credit report. To dispute via mail, write a letter describing the credit report and submit copies of any proof you have. The credit bureau investigates and removes the entry if they find that is indeed an error.
Don't spend your money on those credit repair companies but they are a rip off. You can't get anything off your credit unless its more than 7 yrs old or 10 if its bankruptcy. Just because you paid it off doesn't mean that you can get it taken off the credit report.
A pay for delete offer is a technique you can use with delinquent accounts. In a pay for delete negotiation, you offer to pay the account in full in exchange for having the negative details removed from your credit report. Some creditors will take you up on the offer.
Send a pay for delete offer to your creditor. You have to approach accurately reported negative information differently. Credit bureaus wonât remove accurate, verifiable information even if you dispute it, so you may have to negotiate to have some items removed from your credit report.
How To Remove All Negative Items on Your Credit Report. WARNING: Disputing Legitimate Items (items that do, indeed, belong to you) is Fraud. Please do not attempt to remove items that you are sure belong to you. We are not suggesting that you remove all items from your credit profile, unless they definitely do not belong to you.
Getting your credit report is easy, especially if you havenât used AnnualCreditReport.com yet. You can use this service to pull your credit reports from all 3 credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) quickly and easily, and for free. The law states that all consumers are entitled to 1 free credit report from each of the major bureaus each year.
This gives you the right to not only dispute these negative items, but question how they arrived to their conclusion if they fail to remove them. Letâs discuss how you can remove all of these negative items that do not belong to you. Rule #1: Do NOT use one of those templates that you can easily find on the internet.
Wait out the credit reporting time limit. If all else fails, your only choice is to wait for those negative items to fall off your credit report. Fortunately, the law only allows most negative information to be reported for seven years. The exception is bankruptcy, which can be reported for up to 10 years.

The Senate at that time had 60 Democrats, just enough to pass Obamacare. However after the bill passed the Senate, Democrat Senator Ted Kennedy died. In his place, Massachusetts elected Republican Scott Brown.
This second bill was called the Reconciliation Act of 2010. So the House passed PPACA, the Senate bill, as well as their Reconciliation Act. At this point PPACA was ready for the President to sign, but the Senate still needed to pass the Reconciliation Act from the House.
It was the trickiest legislative move ever accomplished in the Congress. Hereâs my best play-by-play: Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010. If you recall, Nancy Pelosiâs Democratic majority in the House of Representatives was unable to pass their version of a healthcare law. Because all revenue bills have to originate in the House, the Senate found a bill that met those qualifications: HR3590, a military housing bill. They essentially stripped the bill of its original language and turned it into the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), aka Obamacare.
For Immediate Release: WASHINGTON â Legislation dubbed the Deny Americans the Right to Know, or DARK, Act passed the House of Representatives today, but the fight for a more transparent food industry is only just beginning, EWGâs Scott Faber said following the vote.
This bill is an attack on statesâ ability to assure their citizens are informed.â. Pompeoâs bill â christened the âDeny Americans the Right-to-Knowâ or DARK act by critics â would prevent states from adopting GE labeling laws that have gained widespread support over the last two years.
Industry groups that stand to gain the most if the DARK Act becomes law have been some of Pompeoâs biggest campaign contributors. Since 1989, agribusiness has given him nearly $170,000, and the food and beverage industry more than $81,000, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
âItâs outrageous that some House lawmakers voted to ignore the wishes of nine out of 10 Americans,â said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs for EWG. âTodayâs vote to deny Americans the right to know whatâs in their food and how itâs grown was a foregone conclusion.
âWe continue to hope that thoughtful food companies that listen to their customers will work with consumer groups to craft a non-judgmental GMO disclosure to put on the back of food packaging. Americans should have the same right as citizens of 64 other countries to know whatâs in their food and how itâs grown.â.
More than 300 organizations, companies and food industry and social justice leaders oppose the DARK Act in the face of massive spending and lobbying by big chemical and food companies. Poll after poll has shown that a large majority of residents of key states and across the country support mandatory GMO labeling.
Connecticut, along with Maine, also passed a law requiring GE labeling. More than 30 other states are taking up legislation to require GE labeling in 2014. Pompeoâs measure would also limit the authority of the federal Food and Drug Administration to compel companies to disclose GE ingredients.
Carpal Tunnel syndrome, or a laceration to the Median Nerve at the wrist, is called a low Median Nerve injury because it occurs in the lower part of the arm (near the wrist). Most of the muscles that are given function by this nerve are not affected by a low nerve injury.
median nerve. one of the terminal branches of the brachial plexus that extends along the radial parts of the forearm and the hand and supplies various muscles and the skin of these parts. It arises from the brachial plexus by two large roots, one from the lateral and one from the medial cord.
median nerve. One of the two major nerves of the arm, supplying most of the muscles and providing sensation in the two-thirds of the hand on the thumb side. Median nerve. A nerve which runs through the wrist and into the hand. It provides sensation and some movement to the hand, the thumb, the index finger, the middle finger, and half of the ring finger. Mentioned in: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
The Median Nerve travels down the front of your arm and enters into the palm of your hand. The classic Median Nerve injury is carpal tunnel syndrome (see talk here), where pressure slowly develops within the carpal tunnel and pinches this nerve causing numbness in the hand and weakness in the thumb.
The brachial plexus supplies all of the cutaneous innervation of the upper limb, except for the area of the axilla (which is supplied by the supraclavicular nerve) and the dorsal scapula area, which is supplied by cutaneous branches of the dorsal rami.
The nerve to the subclavius muscle is a small filament that arises from the upper trunk. It descends to the subclavius muscle in front of the subclavian artery and the lower trunk of the plexus. The suprascapular nerve arises from the upper trunk formed by the union of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves.
Median nerve. The median nerve is a nerve in humans and other animals in the upper limb. It is one of the five main nerves originating from the brachial plexus. The median nerve originates from the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus, and has contributions from ventral roots of C5-C7(lateral cord) and C8 & T1 (medial cord).
The brachial plexus (plexus brachialis) is a somatic nerve plexus formed by intercommunications among the ventral rami (roots) of the lower 4 cervical nerves (C5-C8) and the first thoracic nerve (T1).
The median nerve may divide into two nerve bundles in the distal forearm and appear as a bifid median nerve in the carpal tunnel. It has an incidence of ~3%. The median nerve usually divides into two or three branches after exiting the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament that covers the carpal tunnel. These subdivide into digital nerves that supply opposing sides of the digits.
Anomalies of. median nerve have been precisely described by Lanz. and can be classified into four types; a) motor branch. variations, b) distally arising accessory branch, c) high. division of median nerve, and d) proximally arising. accessory branch [3]. Classical description of five.

Exclusive Right to Sell. Giving a real estate agent the exclusive right to sell your property does not mean that there will not be other agents involved. Your agent is the listing agent and the most important part of his or her job is to market your home to other agents who work with buyers. Those agents will show your home to their clients.

Flail chest describes a situation in which a portion of the rib cage is separated from the rest of the chest wall, usually due to a severe blunt trauma, such as a serious fall or a car accident.he Mechanics of Flail Chest. For a person to draw a breath, the muscles around the rib cage and the diaphragm have to move to expand the chest cavity. This creates a vacuum that is filled as air enters the lungs. If this expansion is hindered, the ability to draw air into the lungs is diminished.

Most commonly seen in cerebellar disease, this gait is described as clumsy, staggering movements with a wide-based gait. While standing still, the patient's body may swagger back and forth and from side to side, known as titubation.
Problems with any of these areas can lead to walking difficulties, falls, or injury if not addressed. Walking difficulties can be temporary or long-term, depending on the cause. Symptoms of gait and balance problems. The most common symptoms of gait and balance problems include: difficulty walking; trouble with balance; unsteadiness; People can experience: dizziness; light-headedness; vertigo; motion sickness; double vision; Other symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause or condition. What causes gait and balance problems?

The links below will provide you with more detailed information on these medical conditions from the WebMD Symptom Checker and help provide a better understanding of causes and treatment of these related conditions.
Different gait patterns are characterized by differences in limb movement patterns, overall velocity, forces, kinetic and potential energy cycles, and changes in the contact with the surface (ground, floor, etc.). Human gaits are the various ways in which a human can move, either naturally or as a result of specialized training.
Gait Other Causes The various causes are multiple : Chronic diseases that may have an impact on the physical ability to move, that is to say the cardiorespiratory functions: cardiac or respiratory failure, anemia, impaired general condition.
The Gait Abnormality Rating Scale (GARS) is a videotape-based analysis of 16 facets of human gait: the total score represents a rank ordering of risk for falling, based on the number of gait abnormalities recognised and the severity of the gait abnormality.
Most gait problems can be helped to some extent by physical therapy, the use of appropriate assistive devices and, in some cases, medications for spasticity, fatigue, and walking speed (e.g., Ampyra). Your physical therapist may suggest exercises or gait training such as vestibular exercises â designed to induce brief periods of loss of balance.

Prior to Maslow, researchers generally focused separately on such factors as biology, achievement, or power to explain what energizes, directs, and sustains human behavior. Maslow posited a hierarchy of human needs based on two groupings: deficiency needs and growth needs. Within the deficiency needs, each lower need must be met before moving to the next higher level.
The term âTheory-Theoryâ derives from Adam Morton (1980), who proposed that our everyday understanding of human psychology constitutes a kind of theory by which we try to predict and explain behavior in terms of its causation by beliefs, intentions, emotions, traits of character, and so on.
Behaviorism, also known as behavioral psychology, is a theory of learning based on the idea that all behaviors are acquired through conditioning. Conditioning occurs through interaction with the environment. Behaviorists believe that our responses to environmental stimuli shape our actions.
Behaviorism Advocates. John B. Watson (1878-1958) and B. F. Skinner (1904-1990) are the two principal originators of behaviorist approaches to learning. Watson believed that human behavior resulted from specific stimuli that elicited certain responses.
Prototype theory derives in large part from the work of Eleanor Rosch and her collaborators (Rosch, 1977; Rosch & Mervis, 1975; see Smith & Medin, 1981 for historical perspective and Hampton, 1995 for a canonical statement of the view).
Fourth, Theory-Theory is often motivated by the hypothesis that certain concepts (or categories) have a kind of coherence that makes them seem especially non-arbitrary (Murphy & Medin, 1985; Medin & Wattenmaker, 1987).
According to this school of thought, behavior can be studied in a systematic and observable manner regardless of internal mental states. Basically, only observable behavior should be consideredâcognitions, emotions, and moods are far too subjective.
One of the greatest strengths of behavioral psychology is the ability to clearly observe and measure behaviors. Weaknesses of this approach include failing to address cognitive and biological processes that influence human actions.
Watson's basic premise was that conclusions about human development should be based on observation of overt behavior rather than speculation about subconscious motives or latent cognitive processes. (Shaffer, 2000). Watson's view of learning was based in part on the studies of Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936).

FAQ on Federal Leave Law. What is FMLA? FMLA refers to the Family and Medical Leave Act, which is a federal law that guarantees certain employees up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave each year with no threat of job loss. FMLA also requires that employers covered by the law maintain the health benefits for eligible workers just as if they were working. FMLA is a complicated law, but the answers to the questions below can help you understand what your rights and responsibilities are under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Intermittent leave under Non-FMLA is not permitted unless such leave has been approved as a reasonable disability related accommodation pursuant to the ADAAA. Requests for disability related accommodations should be made to the Equal Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Disability Services Department.
An employee must complete an online Leave of Absence Request Form for a medical leave to his/her department management as soon as practicable. Authorization from a health care provider must be sent to Human Resources, Employee Relations and must contain the following information:
An employee may request a medical leave of absence for a serious health condition which renders them unable to perform the functions of their job, an on the job injury, or an illness contracted while on the job. A serious health condition is defined as any illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition.
An employee who is taking Non-FMLA Medical Leave must use all accrued time off banks prior to being placed in an unpaid leave status. Unpaid Status. Accrued time off ceases when the employee moves to an unpaid status. Accrued time off will restart upon the employee's return to paid status.
B. Certifications for Non-FMLA Medical Leave. Vanderbilt University will require certification for the employee's serious health condition. Human Resources will receive all medical certifications. The employee must respond to the request for certification within 15 calendar days of the notice of eligibility.
The Emory Faculty Staff Assistance Program is available: Â· To authorize an employeeâs need for absence from work, or a medical leave of absence based on clinical review. Â· To facilitate communications with an employeeâs department or the employeeâs return to work based on medical authorization/clinical review.
FMLA only applies to certain employees. First, the employee must work for a covered employer (see the question above). Second, the employee must work for the employer for a minimum of 12 months, and at least 1,250 hours during those 12 months, before taking leave under FMLA.
I. Non-FMLA Medical Leave of Absence. Leave within First Year of Employment. An employee with a serious medical condition as defined under the FMLA, who is in his or her first year of employment and has completed the initial orientation period, may request a leave of absence for a self-qualifying medical event.
Employee not eligible for FMLA leave still protected by non-discrimination provisions. Many employers offer leave of absence benefits to employees that supplement leaves of absence provided by the Family and Medical Leave Act. Indeed, many employers use their procedures for processing an FMLA leave request when considering and granting non-FMLA leaves. As illustrated by a recent case, this overlap may result in confusion (or claims of confusion) giving otherwise non-eligible employees rights under the FMLA.

A kilowatt-hour is the amount of energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour, or 3.6 megajoules. Energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example: a 100-watt (i.e. 0.1 kilowatt) light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800 Wâh or 0.8 kWâh.If the energy cost is 25 cents per kilowatt-hour, it would cost 0.1 kW Ã 8 h Ã $0.25/kWâh = $0.20.Whereas individual homes only pay for the kilowatt-hours consumed, commercial buildings and institutions also pay for peak power consumption (the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time, such as 15 minutes).he kilowatt-hour (symbolized kWâh) is a unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1 kW) of power sustained for one hour. One watt is equal to 1 J/s. One kilowatt-hour is 3.6 megajoules, which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour.
The unit that both gas and electricity are measured in is kilowatt hours (kWh). One kWh of gas is approximately equivalent to leaving a small gas hob burner on for an hour. One kWh of electricity is the rough equivalent of running a washing machine for an hour.

The price of electricity in the UK in 2013 averages 17.2 pence per kWh according to updated analysis of CompareMySolar, following last years article.he following graph gives average rates for Low (2100 kWh per year), Medium (3300 kWh) and High (5100 kWh) electricity users that either pay by direct debit (cheaper) or standard credit (more expensive): This gives us the following average price per kWh per energy company 1  : British Gas: 16.6 pence per kWh.
Calculations of these costs at the point of connection to a load or to the electricity grid can be made. The cost is typically given per kilowatt-hour or megawatt-hour. It includes the initial capital, discount rate, as well as the costs of continuous operation, fuel, and maintenance.This type of calculation assists policy makers, researchers and others to guide discussions and decision making.hat method arrives at external costs of electricity from lignite at 10.75 Eurocent/kWh, from hard coal 8.94 Eurocent/kWh, from natural gas 4.91 Eurocent/kWh, from photovoltaic 1.18 Eurocent/kWh, from wind 0.26 Eurocent/kWh and from hydro 0.18 Eurocent/kWh.
1 Unit rate-this is the price you will pay per unit (kWh) of energy, so it can fluctuate depending on how much energy you use. Standing charge-this is a fixed amount that you are charged each day, regardless of how much gas or electricity you use. 2  Unit rate-this is the price you will pay per unit (kWh) of energy, so it can fluctuate depending on how much energy you use.
Confidence votes 18.3K. The frequency and the amplitude are related in such a way that, the greater the amplitude the greater is the energy. The sound pressure amplitude tells about how loud the tone will be and the frequency (cycles per second) of the oscillation tells how high the sound of the tone will be.
Difference Between Amplitude and Frequency. Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
Wavelength. 1  Frequency tells us how many waves are passing a point per second, the inverse of time. 2  Wavelength tells us the length of those waves in metres, almost like a displacement. 3  If we multiply these two together, we are really multiplying 1/s and mâ¦ which gives us m/s, the velocity of the wave!
In this article, we are going to discuss what frequency and amplitude are, their definitions, the measurement and dependencies of amplitude and frequency, and finally the difference between amplitude and frequency. Frequency. Frequency is a concept discussed in periodic motions of objects.
Amplitude vs Frequency . Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
What is the difference between amplitude and frequency? â¢ Amplitude strictly depends on the total energy of the system, whereas frequency of an oscillation depends on the properties of the oscillator itself. â¢ For a given system, the amplitude can be changed but frequency cannot.
Amplitude vs Frequency. Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
Amplitude decides the intensity ie energy content of the wave and frequency is different right from amplitude. If the maximum amplitude,E, i â¦ s known then the instantaneous amplitude, e, can be found by e=E*sin(2*pi*f*t) where f is the frequency and t is the time in seconds from the start of the sine wave.
Amplitude vs Frequency Amplitude and frequency are two of the basic properties of periodic motions. A proper understanding in these concepts is required in the study of motions such as simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions.
amplitude is the height of the wave from the middle point, it can be either from the middle to the bottom, or middle to the top of the wave. the frequency is how frequent the â¦ crests of each wave (the amplitude) pass a given point. so how they relate is, the highest point/lowest point is the crest, and the that is the amplitude is the ends of the crests ===== (In other words, to paraphrase the above remarks, there is no relationship between the amplitude and frequency of a wave.
The fundamental purpose of the board is to preside over something called the Doomsday Clock. The symbolic time piece was created in 1947 as a way to highlight the threat of global nuclear war but has since grown to involve some of the worldâs greatest minds â including 15 Nobel Laureates â who meet to examine the urgent challenges facing humanity.
Just what is the Doomsday Clock? 1:18 The Doomsday Clock is a theoretical indicator of how close humanity is to a doomsday event. Started in 1947, the board of scientists who decide what the clock says has included Einstein, Oppenheimer and is now chaired by theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss.
You can check it at: What is the 'Doomsday Clock'? The Islamic teachings that are found in the Holy Quran or in the words of Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (SAWS), do address the details of The Day of Judgement.
But i will give you a quotations for a better understanding. Similarly, in 1947 the experts from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists magazine of the University of Chicago instituted the so-called âDoomsday Clockâ â a symbolic reference point that has the purpose to show how close the world is to self-destruction.
In 1947, at the start of the Cold War, the clock was set at 23:53, seven minutes before midnight â the symbol for global disaster. Ever since, the clock has been repeatedly readjusted by the directors of the magazine in order to correspond to reality.
The Doomsday Clock: Menacing Metaphor of the Nuclear Age. Pessimism is on the rise. Mercurial politicians, rising nationalism and isolationism, international bluster, a changing climate, mass protests, and many other occurrences are contributing to a generally gloomy mood.
âThe purpose of the Doomsday Clock is to provide a graphical way for people to suddenly think about these existential threats,â Prof Krauss said. âPeople tend to avoid thinking about these existential threats and donât talk about them.â
The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face, representing a countdown to possible global catastrophe (e.g. nuclear war or climate change). It has been maintained since 1947 by the members of the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,[1] who are in turn advised by the Governing Board and the Board of Sponsors, including 18 Nobel Laureates.
Originally Answered: What is the doomsday clock? Does it really matter? The members of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists created the clock as an analogy to how close the world was/is to destruction.
Reflecting this, the doomsday clock was recently moved to 2 minutes 30 seconds, the closest it has been to doomsday in decades. That sounds ominous, but what is the doomsday clock? The doomsday clock was created by The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, a journal founded as a response to atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Most of the founding editors were scientists who helped to develop atomic weapons in the first place. The clock first appeared on the Bulletinâs cover in 1947, and has appeared in the table of contents
Ear infections are less common in adults than in children, but they may be more serious or more difficult to treat. Ear infections are less common in adults than in children, but they may be more serious or more difficult to treat.
One of the reasons children are more likely than adults to get ear infections is that their eustachian tubes are smaller and more horizontal than the tubes in most adults. If you have small eustachian tubes or you have tubes that havenât developed more of a slope, youâre at a higher risk for developing an ear infection.
What is an Ear Infection? Infection can affect the ear canal (otitis externa), the eardrum , or the middle ear (otitis media). Most ear injuries are caused by pressure changes during direct injury (such as a blow to the ear) or sport scuba diving, but, a persistently painful ear may signal an infection that requires treatment.
Chronic ear infection symptoms may be less noticeable than those of acute ear infections. Children younger than 6 months who have a fever or ear infection symptoms should see a doctor. Always seek medical attention if your child has a fever higher than 102Â°F or severe ear pain.
Ear infections are often caused by bacterial infections. But whether you get an outer or middle ear infection depends on how you become infected. Middle ear infection. A middle ear infection often originates from a cold or other respiratory problem. The infection moves to one or both ears through the eustachian tubes.
Seek medical treatment as soon as possible for an examination of the ear if an ear infection is suspected. Seek medical treatment immediately if you experience a sudden loss in hearing in one or both ears (usually occurring over a period of less than 24-48 hours).
Most mild ear infections clear up without intervention. Some of the following methods are effective in relieving the symptoms of a mild ear infection: applying a warm cloth to the affected ear; taking over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen; using over-the-counter or prescription ear drops to relieve pain
Ear infections may be more common in children than in adults, but grown-ups are still susceptible to these infections. Unlike childhood ear infections, which are often minor and pass quickly, adult ear infections are frequently signs of a more serious health problem.
Symptoms of ear infection include: ear pain, fullness in the ear, hearing loss, ringing in the ear, discharge from the ear, nausea, vomiting, and; vertigo. Symptoms may follow a respiratory infection such as the common cold. Discharge from the ear canal is often caused by the infection known as swimmer's ear (otitis externa). A painful ear with decreased hearing is often the result of otitis media, an middle ear infection.
An ear infection occurs when a bacterial or viral infection affects the middle ear â the sections of your ear just behind the eardrum. Ear infections can be painful because of inflammation and fluid build-up in the middle ear. Ear infections can be chronic or acute. Acute ear infections are painful but short in duration. Chronic ear infections either do not clear up, or they recur many times. Chronic ear infections can cause permanent damage to the middle and inner ear.
Fields of Anthropology. There are now four major fields of anthropology: biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archaeology. Each focuses on a different set of research interests and generally uses different research techniques.
In the first topic room, entitled Scientific Underpinnings, you will meet biological anthropologists, learn how evolution serves as a backbone of their studies, and discover how these scientists go about the business of testing a hypothesis in the first place.
A PROCESS of Observation and Deduction... Observation - gatherinâ¦. Evidence supporting and not supporting a theory. - When a hypothesis has been tested and retested over many yeaâ¦. - An intellectual framework that is the result of testing a thâ¦.
Biological Anthropology. Biological (or physical) anthropologists carry out systematic studies of the non-cultural aspects of humans and near-humans. Non-cultural refers to all of those biological characteristics that are genetically inherited in contrast to learned.
Biological Anthropology. The graduate program in biological anthropology at CU Boulder offers training in several areas, including primatology, human biology, and paleoanthropology. We share an interest in human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.
Where do we come from? Where are we going? These are some of the big questions biological anthropology seeks to answer, using the principles of evolution as a backdrop for formulating and testing hypotheses about humanity's past, present, and future.
-has an influence of human nature & society. -set of learned behaviour and ideas that human beings acquire as members of society. Human beings use culture to adapt to and to transform the world in which they live in. -culture makes us unique. (an e.g of this is that humans need to learn how to survive--> focus in childhood stages)
Graduate Study in Anthropology. The graduate program in biological anthropology at CU Boulder offers training in several areas, including primatology, human biology, and paleoanthropology. We share an interest in human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.
Anthropology is the study of various aspects of humans within past and present societies. Social anthropology and cultural anthropology study the norms and values of societies. Linguistic anthropology studies how language affects social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.
Biological Anthropology. 1  Biological Anthropology is the study of the evolution and ecology of humans and other primates, grounded in an understanding of evolutionary history and extending to applied subjects such as conservation and human development. The UCL Biological Anthropology section is one of the largest groups of academics in Europe that focuses on these subjects.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. The first President of the United States to live in the White House was John Adams, with his wife Abigail Adams. President Washington laid the cornerstone, but it wasn't finished until the final years of Adams's term. President Jefferson was the first to fully live in the building during his entire presidency.
President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, moved into the White House in 1800, shortly before it was completed. Construction began in 1792.
President Harry S. Truman began a renovation of the building in which everything but the outer walls were dismantled. The reconstruction was overseen by architect Lorenzo Winslow, and the Truman family moved back into the White House in 1952.
There are five living former First Ladies: Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter; Nancy Reagan, widow of Ronald Reagan; Barbara Bush, wife of George H. W. Bush; Hillary Clinton, wife of Bill Clinton; and Laura Bush, wife of George W. Bush. The first First Lady was Martha Washington, married to George Washington.
The Office of the First Lady is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House, and is a branch of the Executive Office of the President. According to the White House and the National First Ladies' Library, there have been forty-five First Ladies and forty-six First Ladyships.
Following Barack Obama 's first inauguration on January 20, 2009, his wife, Michelle Obama, became the forty-sixth official First Lady, succeeding Laura Bush, wife of former President George W. Bush.
One woman who was not married to a President but who is still considered an official First Lady: Harriet Lane, niece of bachelor James Buchanan. The other non-spousal relatives who served as White House hostesses are not recognized by the First Ladies' Library.
The White House was under construction while President George Washington served in office, and because of this he never used it as his residence. President John Adams and his wife Abigail were the first residents when they moved in November 1800, although the White House was still undergoing some final renovations.
Our first president, George Washington, selected the site for the White House in 1791. The cornerstone was laid in 1792 and a competition design submitted by Irish-born architect James Hoban was chosen. After eight years of construction, President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, moved into the unfinished house in 1800.
1 At various times in history, the White House has been known as the President's Palace, the President's House, and the Executive Mansion.. 2  President Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901. 3  Presidential Firsts while in office...

The skin is often known as the largest organ of the human body. This applies to exterior surface, as it covers the body, appearing to have the largest surface area of all the organs. Moreover, it applies to weight, as it weighs more than any single internal organ, accounting for about 15 percent of body weight.
Answer: Liver. The human liver is a critical organ that plays a major role in the regulation of glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, hormone production, detoxification, and aiding digestion, among other things.
The largest organ of the body is liver . there is a major misconception that largest organ is skin or liver is largest organ inside body.
Skin is the human body's largest organ. A surgeon prepares to transplant skin at a burn victim care center. Skin grafts and transplants help reduce infection and fluid loss (which burn patients with extensive skin loss are especially susceptible to), but transplants carry several risks, including bleeding, infection, and rejection of the graft.
, Human Body: A Mind Boggling machine. The longest bone in the human body is the femur. The largest artery is the aorta and the largest vein is the inferiorvena cava. The largest internal organ is the liver. It is also the heaviest organ, with an average of 1.6 kilograms (3.5 pounds). The largest organ is definitely the skin.
Don't worry, it should be. Your epidermis is the top part of your skin, and your skin is your body's largest and fastest-growing organ. Skin is your body's coat. It protects you. It helps you stay warm when it's cold, and cool when it's hot. Your skin keeps all your insides in, from your heart and lungs to your blood and muscles.
As such, itâs no surprise that the liver, a veritable power house of metabolic processes and critical to our survival, is the largest internal organ by both weight and volumeâthe average adult liver is around 1.44â1.66 kilograms (3.2â3.7 pounds) in weight and approximately 885-1,220 milliliters in volume.
Body organs aren't all internal like the brain or the heart. There's one we wear on the outside. Skin is our largest organâadults carry some 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) and 22 square feet (2 square meters) of it. This fleshy covering does a lot more than make us look presentable.
The skin is the largest organ of the human body and of all mammals. In the average adult it weighs around six pounds, which is nearly twice the weight of the human brain or liâ¦ver. Internally, the largest organ is the liver which weighs around 1.6 pounds. A curmudgeon with years of practice.
The largest internal organ is the liver. It is also the heaviest organ, with an average of 1.6 kilograms (3.5 pounds). The largest external organ, which is also the largest organ in general, is the skin. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_body_part.
By simply attaching a valved holding chamber or spacer to your metered-dose inhaler, you can: 1  Help the medicine move past your mouth and throat and get deep into your lungs where it gets to work. 2  Avoid problems with spraying and breathing at the same time. 3  Avoid breathing the medicine in too fast.
MicroSpacerÂ® is an aerosol spacer device for use with metered dose inhalers (MDI). Using an MDI without a spacer often results in aerosol medication ending up in the mouth, throat, trachea, and even the stomach. In contrast, MicroSpacer very effectively delivers aerosol medication from your MDI directly to the lungs, where it is needed most.
There are several types of spacers and valved holding chambers to choose from. 1  Together, you and your healthcare provider can decide if a spacer or valved holding chamber is right for you and which type will best meet your needs. Here are a few questions to ask your healthcare providers:
General: 1  MicroSpacerÂ® is very easy to use. 2  Cleaning. 3  Wash MicroSpacer daily (or at least weekly) by running it under warm tap water, followed by drying with a soft, lint-free cloth or leaving to dry overnight. 4  Replacement. 5  Multiple MicroSpacers.
MicroSpacer for Metered Dose Inhalers. The MicroSpacerÂ® fits most Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI). Easily drops into bag, pocket or purse, and costs much less than similar devices. Small, convenient to carry, MicroSpacerÂ® is dishwasher safe, latex free and provides anti-static delivery of your medication. MicroSpacer for Metered Dose Inhalers is the spacer device only and the Metered Dose Inhalers are not included.
Features: 1  Optimizes MDI medication benefits by delivering more medication to the lungs. 2  Offers great portability for people on the go. 3  Clinically proven to be as effective as larger spacers, but at much less cost. 4  Compatible with most MDI products. 5  Attaches to MDI in seconds, and easily detaches for cleaning.
Valved holding chambers and spacers are very similar devices; both are plastic tubes that attach to your metered-dose inhaler and are recommended for adults and children. A spacer is a device that is placed on the mouthpiece of your quick relief inhaler. When used, a spacer creates space between your mouth and the medicine. This space helps the medicine break into smaller droplets. The smaller droplets can move easier and deeper into your lungs when you breathe in your medicine.
This asthma inhaler spacer easily drops into a bag, pocket or purse, and costs much less than similar devices. Small, convenient to carry, MicroSpacerÂ® is dishwasher safe, latex free and provides anti-static delivery of your medication. MicroSpacer for Metered Dose Inhalers is the spacer device only and the Metered Dose Inhalers are not included.
MicroSpacer is FDA 510K approved as substantially equivalent to other spacer devices, and is the smallest aerosol asthma inhaler spacer on the market. Replace every 4-6 months. Box contains one (1) MicroSpacerÂ® device and full instructions.
Optimize inhaler benefits with the MicroSpacer for Metered Dose Inhalers. This asthma inhaler spacer is a portable, cost-effective way to take your medication.
Next (Stage III), the peptidoglycan in the septum is degraded and the forespore is engulfed by the mother cell, forming a cell within a cell. The activities of the mother cell and forespore lead to the synthesis of the endospore-specific compounds, formation of the cortex and deposition of the coat (Stages IV+V).
In addition, spores that form at higher temperatures will naturally have lower core water content, and thus, have greater wet heat resistance [11] . Dry heat causes significant DNA damage in a vegetative cell [11] . As a result, SASPs play a major role in the dry heat resistance of spores.
The center of the endospore, the core, exists in a very dehydrated state and houses the cell's DNA, ribosomes and large amounts of dipicolinic acid. This endospore-specific chemical can comprise up to 10% of the spore's dry weight and appears to play a role in maintaining spore dormancy.
Heat Resistance. Wet heat resistance is a notable characteristic of spores when suspended in an aqueous medium. Generally, wet heat resistance allows spores to be resistant to temperatures 40 degrees celsius higher than their respective vegetative form [11] . The major determinant of wet heat resistance is the core water content [10] .
When favored nutrients are exhausted, some bacteria may become motile to seek out nutrients, or they may produce enzymes to exploit alternative resources. One example of an extreme survival strategy employed by certain low G+C Gram-positive bacteria is the formation of endospores.
The resilience of an endospore can be explained in part by its unique cellular structure. The outer proteinaceous coat surrounding the spore provides much of the chemical and enzymatic resistance. Beneath the coat resides a very thick layer of specialized peptidoglycan called the cortex.
Endospores are dormant, non-reproductive and enzymatically inert forms of bacterial vegetative cells [1] . Endospore-producing bacteria are more conventionally termed âsporulating bacteriaâ. Sporulating bacteria are derived from the [1] Firmicute phylum and mainly consist of [2] Gram positive bacteria [7] .
Endospores and Epulopiscium: Some Epulopiscium-like surgeonfish symbionts form mature endospores at night. These spores possess all of the characteristic protective layers seen in B. subtilis endospores and also contain large amounts of dipicolinic acid.
1. The endospore is released from the cell and can remain dormant for thousands of years. 2.Germination (The process where the endospores returns to its vegetative state) is triggered by physical or chemical damage to the endospore's coat. 3. The endospore's enzymes break down the extra layers.
The endospore consists of the bacterium's DNA, ribosomes and large amounts of dipicolinic acid. Dipicolinic acid is a spore-specific chemical that appears to help in the ability for endospores to maintain dormancy. This chemical comprises up to 10% of the spore's dry weight.
A lot of these responsibilities will depend on the terms of your consulting contract. For example, some companies may expect a consulting firm to monitor and maintain any security plan that is implemented. In a large organization, you will typically collaborate with IT Project Managers and/or a Security Manager.
So You Want to Be a Security Expert. I regularly receive e-mail from people who want advice on how to learn more about computer security, either as a course of study in college or as an IT person considering it as a career choice. First, know that there are many subspecialties in computer security. You can be an expert in keeping systems from being hacked, or in creating unhackable software. You can be an expert in finding security problems in software, or in networks. You can be an expert in viruses, or policies, or cryptography.
It is the responsibility of the security consultant to provide security to individuals, business enterprises, commercial establishments, factories, retail outlets and many more business types.
1 Enroll yourself in a training program that offers certification as a Security Consultant. 2  A relevant degree can also be obtained, but is not necessary. 3  Graduates in electrical and electronics subjects could obtain special certifications to become a security consultant.
To succeed as a security consultant, you will require a professional certificate backed by a few years of meaningful experience as a full-time security head for a reputed company. It may also be useful for you to possess a university degree. Here is a step by step procedure to become a security consultant. Step1: Obtain a Degree. The first step for you is to obtain a bachelor's degree in any stream of study from a recognized university.
Degree Requirements. All Security Consultants must understand IT security from the ground-up. That means organizations and consulting firms will require â at minimum â a bachelorâs degree in Computer Science, Cyber Security or a related field (e.g. Engineering).
To become a Security Consultant, you should consider gaining your work experience in intermediate-level security jobs such as: 1  Security Administrator. 2  Security Specialist. 3  Security Analyst. 4  Security Engineer. 5  Security Auditor.
1 Do. 2  Computer security is fundamentally a practitioner's art, and that requires practice. 3  This means using what you've learned to configure security systems, design new security systems, and -- yes -- break existing security systems.
One can be a security consultant in a number of ways. Some firms insist on having a license, while for others, it's not mandatory as long as one possesses required qualifications. If one aspires to become a security consultant, then the following guidelines would come in handy: 1  A bachelor's degree in any subject. 2  Enroll yourself in a training program that offers certification as a Security Consultant. 3  A relevant degree can also be obtained, but is not necessary.
A security consultant performs assessments on infrastructures like residential homes, companies, institutions, places of public importance like airports, railway stations and stadiums and suggests optimum security measures to be adopted.
MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drone pilots will be eligible for retention bonuses worth up to $135,000 beginning in fiscal 2016 under a new policy announced by the Air Force.
According to Al Palmer, director of the center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems at the University of North Dakota, drone pilots are paid about $50 an hour, CNN reported.
Pilots who accept the bonus will no longer be eligible for the expanded monthly flight pay James approved in January, Karns said. That change increased the maximum amount 18X drone pilots can get from $650 per month to $1,500, if they keep flying unmanned aircraft beyond their six-year commitments. But pilots getting the bonus will still get the standard $650 monthly flight pay. The extra monthly flight pay adds up to $10,200 per year, meaning that by accepting the new $15,000 annual bonus, these pilots would get an extra $4,800 per year. The bonuses are similar to, but different from the up to $225,000 Aviator Retention Pay bonus that this year became available to some 11U RPA pilots.
Operating a high-tech aircraft by remote control looking for bad guys would seem like a dream job with thousands of hopeful drone pilots lining up too quickly fill any shortage. Working as a drone pilot is no picnic, however.
According to a 2013 report from the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, as many as 100,000 new jobs will be created in the first 10 years after the use of drones becomes legal in US airspace.
'$100,000 a year': Headhunt for drone pilots in USA. Get short URL. Drone pilots and engineers are certainly careers with a future in the US. Although commercial drones arenât legal yet, reports reveal that companies are already willing to pay unbelievably high salaries, in the expectation of rules softening. Tags SciTech, Information Technology, USA, Drones.
The Air Force recently increased monthly bonuses for drone pilots from $650 to $1,500 if they keep flying unmanned aircraft beyond a six-year commitment. But a Government Accountability Office report in May found few pilots eligible for the extra bonuses.
'Every single day this base is at war. These kids are not playing video games out of their mothers' basements'. The pilots sit in dimly lit, air-conditioned trailers, each staring at glowing video and data screens and toggling a joystick that controls an armed drone flying somewhere in the world.
Some 1,066 pilots fly drones from Creech and other bases, fewer than the 1,281 that the Air Force says it needs to fulfill a Pentagon mandate of 65 daily missions, called combat air patrols. A patrol has one to four aircraft.
As a result, pilots here work up to 12 hours a day. Some are clocking 1,100 flight hours a year, four times the number flown by traditional pilots, according to Pentagon data. âIt does get eye-glazing, there's no ifs, ands or buts about it,â said a drone pilot who was not authorized to speak on the record.

St. Anne. The name Anne derives from the Hebrew, Hannah, meaning âGraceâ. Saint Anne was born in Bethlehem and became the wife of Saint Joachim from Nazareth, in Galilee. Joachim was a shepherd, given the responsibility of supplying sheep for the templeâs sacrifices in Jerusalem. They were both of the royal House of David, and their lives were wholly occupied in prayer and good works.
In 550 AD, a church was built in honour of Saint Anne in Jerusalem, near where she lived with Joachim and Mary. Here is the present day church and ruins in Jerusalem. Her feast day is July 26th.
Michael was born on April 15, 1797, the eldest son of Arnold and Gratianne Garicoits. They were poor and Michael was hired out as a shepherd boy to a farmer. His desire to become a priest always met with No, we are too poor by his parents, but his grandmother talked the matter over with the parish priest.
The ascending aorta when shows a diameter from 3.9 to 4.4 cm we consider as mild ectasia, 4.5 to 4.9 cm moderate ectasia, and when it presents a diameter larger than 4.9 cm we consider aneurysm of the aorta.â. slide 4 of 8.
I was first told that my aorta is slightly dilated at 4.0 cm. There is some variation in the way the term aneurysm is used. For the thoracic aorta, most agree that at a diameter of 4.0 cm it has reached a size that is considered an aneurysm. The word dilated refers to the enlargement of the aorta.
I have an ascending aortic aneurysm. Aneurysmal aortic tissue is thin, weak and fragile. Beta blockers and blood pressure medications are important in reducing the pressure on the fragile aortic tissue and lowering the risk of aneurysm rupture or dissection.
The aorta is the main blood vessel that carries blood to the rest of the body. In patients with Marfan Syndrome, the walls of the aorta are weaker than normal. This can cause the aorta to enlarge and stretch. An abnormal bulge in the wall of the aorta (an aneurysm) may develop. The inner and outer layers of the aortic wall can also separate (a dissection).
An aneurysm results from weakness in the tissue of the aortic wall. There is no way to restore or strengthen this weakened tissue. The purpose of the blood pressure medication is to slow or prevent further enlargement of the aneurysm and protect against dissection or rupture of the aortic wall.
Though the term âmildâ may indicate a lack in the seriousness of the condition, aortic aneurysms are serious. They can rupture and the risk of that happening increases as the size of the aneurysm grows. A rupture is serious because it can cause internal bleeding that is life-threatening.
My aneurysm was found first on an echocardiogram, and then a CT Scan was done. These tests are generally used to evaluate the heart and the aorta. The echocardiogram is used to evaluate the heart valves and the thickness of the heart wall.
Mild aortic ectasia is defined as an enlargement of the aorta that is mild in degree. This condition is associated with aortic aneurysm. This is because, generally, if the aneurysm diameter is greater than 1.5 times a normal aortaâs size, it is known as an aneurysm. slide 2 of 8.
Another reason symptoms might appear is if the aneurysm causes dissection, meaning a tearing in the artery wall. In this case, the patient may experience stroke, abdominal pain, extremities that feel cold or numb and a severe tearing pain in the regions of the back or chest. slide 6 of 8.
Mild aortic enlargement may not cause any noticeable symptoms at first. An enlarged aorta, however, may allow blood to leak back into the heart, due to aortic valve insufficiency. This can cause shortness of breath and a pounding heartbeat. More severe aortic enlargement can further weaken the aortic wall, causing the aneurysm to enlarge or dissect.
1 Non-Texas residents can apply for services with the Child Support Division of the Office of the Attorney General of Texas, provided there is a Texas child support order or one of the parties or child(ren) resides in Texas.eginning September 1, 2011, custodial parents will pay a $3 monthly fee in cases that receive registry-only payment processing and record-keeping services through the State Disbursement Unit (SDU) for each month in which a child support payment of more than $3 is received.
Confidence votes 305. No. If you are under 18 and not graduated from high school, you should live with either of your parents. If you attempt to file child support for yourself, the court can make you live with the parent that you request child support from, if you are not already living with your custodial parent.n most states, the parent has until the child reaches the age of majority to file, but the child can file for one more years after. In a few states, the limit is 23 years of â¦ age. Some states do not allow for retroactive orders, while a few allows 18 years retroactive.
Share this conversation. Expert: Dave Kennett replied 6 years ago. Dear suk rider-You cannot simply put yourself on child support. Assuming you are a residential parent of a child and have legal custody then you would have to make a motion to the court for a determination of child support from the other parent.f you are asking how to start paying support then you can file a motion with the court to determine custody, support and any other issue involving the child. I really cannot comment further on this limited fact situation. David Kennett-JD-Attorney at Law.

In the state of Texas, child support and visitation are two different animals. You need to petition the court for visitation. Once it's set, she will be required by law to follow the order. You can also contact the Office of the Attorney General for the state of Texas regarding support, if you wish.ust so you know, even if you're not paying child support you have a right to see your daughter. If your ex doesn't request child support, that is her business -- she is legally not allowed to prevent you from seeing your child.

This is an easy way for the non-custodial parent to make child support payments. It also provides the non-custodial parent with a record of payments made. If support payments are not deducted from the non-custodial parent's paycheck, they should be paid as directed in the court order.It is very important to keep records of the payments that are made. The Fatherhood Program can help non-custodial parents who have a case with DCSS and are unable to pay child support.f support payments are not deducted from the non-custodial parent's paycheck, they should be paid as directed in the court order.

An electromagnetic field (also EMF or EM field) is a physical field produced by electrically charged objects. It affects the behavior of charged objects in the vicinity of the field. The electromagnetic field extends indefinitely throughout space and describes the electromagnetic interaction.
Exposure to the very high intensity electromagnetic fields found in the immediate vicinity of certain sources such as radar installations and TV or radio transmitters can produce electrical shock or a variety of heating effects, which may range from a sensation of warmth to burns and eventual cataract formation.
Magnetic fields. 1  Electric fields arise from voltage. 2  Their strength is measured in Volts per metre (V/m) 3  An electric field can be present even when a device is switched off.  Field strength decreases with distance from the 1  source. Most building materials shield electric fields to some extent.  Magnetic fields arise from current flows.
Radiofrequency (RF) and microwave (MW) radiation are electromagnetic radiation in the frequency ranges 3 kilohertz (kHz) - 300 Megahertz (MHz), and 300 MHz - 300 gigahertz (GHz), respectively. RF and MW radiation are non-ionizing in that there is insufficient energy to ionize atoms.
Electromagnetic fields at low frequencies. Electric fields exist whenever a positive or negative electrical charge is present. They exert forces on other charges within the field. The strength of the electric field is measured in volts per metre (V/m).
Radiation Safety Index > Magnetic Fields & Radio Frequency. Electrical devices and systems produce two different fields: an electric field like the one produced on the surface of a wool sweater on a dry winter day, and a magnetic field like the fields produced by a compass needle, a small magnet or the earth itself.
Magnetic fields arise from the motion of electric charges. The strength of the magnetic field is measured in amperes per meter (A/m); more commonly in electromagnetic field research, scientists specify a related quantity, the flux density (in microtesla, ÂµT) instead.
Difference Between Electromagnetic Waves and Radio Waves. Electromagnetic waves are a type of wave that is present in nature. The applications of electromagnetic waves are endless. The theory of electromagnetism is a vast field in classical mechanics and in modern physics, as well.
All electromagnetic waves have the same velocity in vacuum. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave decided the energy stored in it. Later it was shown using quantum mechanics that these waves are, in fact, packets of waves. The energy of this packet depends on the frequency of the wave. This opened the field of wave â particle duality of matter.
From a classical perspective in the history of electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field can be regarded as a smooth, continuous field, propagated in a wavelike manner; whereas from the perspective of quantum field theory, the field is seen as quantized, being composed of individual particles.
Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as lightning, static electricity, electromagnetic induction and electric current. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception of electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves.enjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.
An electric light is a device that produces visible light by the flow of electric current.It is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities.efore electric lighting became common in the early 20th century, people used candles, gas lights, oil lamps, and fires. Most electric lighting is powered by centrally generated electric power, but lighting may also be powered by mobile or standby electric generators or battery systems.
Report Abuse. There's no right answer. Electricity has become steadily more available to more people in the world over the last 100 years. There's no one time when it went from generally unavailable to generally available.oes anybody know when electricity became available as a general household power source-as in changed from gas lamps, candles etc. Update: I do not mean when it was invented, I mean when it was available for any household (maybe in a city) to have access to it.
It was in the late 1870s when America's greatest inventor -- Thomas Alva Edison -- developed and built the first electricity generating plant in New York City. Electric lighting came to Chicago in 1880, when the Palmer House Hotel installed electric lights in time for that year's Republican National Convention.Later that year in Philadelphia the first electric lights were strung along a ten-block stretch of Chestnut Street.lectric lighting came to Chicago in 1880, when the Palmer House Hotel installed electric lights in time for that year's Republican National Convention.

The inductor is a conductor, usually a coil of wire, that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor.The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current.enjamin Franklin conducted extensive research on electricity in the 18th century, as documented by Joseph Priestley (1767) History and Present Status of Electricity, with whom Franklin carried on extended correspondence.
One of the major purposes of the CEB was to promote the use of electricity by industry. By 1936, about 80% of the available supply was used in this sector, although many industrial companies continued to rely on their own oil or gas engines to generate electricity for lighting.Domestic use was originally very limited but gradually expanded from use only by the wealthy.y 1936, about 80% of the available supply was used in this sector, although many industrial companies continued to rely on their own oil or gas engines to generate electricity for lighting.

In 1831 electricity became viable for use in technology when Michael Faraday created the electric dynamo (a crude power generator), which solved the problem of generating electric current in an ongoing and practical way.talian physicist Alessandro Volta discovered that particular chemical reactions could produce electricity, and in 1800 he constructed the voltaic pile (an early electric battery) that produced a steady electric current, and so he was the first person to create a steady flow of electrical charge.

By 1900, it was clear that electric lighting was as good as gas lighting, and likely to overtake it in popularity. The demand for lighting was, of course, largely at night. Power suppliers found that if they were to meet peak night demand, they needed demand during the day as well, otherwise they over-produced.y 1936, about 80% of the available supply was used in this sector, although many industrial companies continued to rely on their own oil or gas engines to generate electricity for lighting.

Robins like cheese and Blackbirds eat dog food: What you should REALLY be feeding birds. Tearing up crispy slices of toast and stale old crusts, spreading them out on the garden bird table then watching from the kitchen window as, one by one, a small feathery flock swoops in to peck and gulp, has always seemed a thrifty and altruistic pleasure.
A Robin's Favorite Winter Foods. In winter robins concentrate on berry bushes, trees and vines, like the bittersweet vine above. (On warm days, though, you might spot a robin running on lawns, searching for worms!) Winter robins eat berries, other fruits, and seeds they find on shrubs, trees, and vines. If robins happen to overwinter near you, you can offer them frozen or fresh fruit.

One notable exception is the refrigerator. There are several reasons why May is a better time to buy a new fridge, Shelton says. Manufacturers introduce new models in the spring, so retailers tend to cut prices in May on the previous yearâs models by as much as 50% to make room.
When to Buy a New Appliance. When it comes to large appliances, many people choose to use their current ones all the way up until the day they die. While this does ensure maximum use, it doesnât allow you to effectively plan a new appliance purchase when appliance prices are at their lowest.
She'll have a mission! I can't wait to get some new appliances, the stove is nearly 20 years old and looks very dated, I'm tasting a solid surface instead of burners!

If you plan ahead, youâll have plenty of time to find a good deal before you desperately need the appliance. This is because there are certain times of year that are best for purchasing washers and dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, stoves/ranges, and the like.
They're marked down around 50% or even more. Toward the end of the year, many new models are in and vendors are trying to get rid of the discontinued or old models. Also, during the holidays, usually many places have items on sale.
The best time to buy most major household appliances is September and October, when new models hit stores and older models need to be cleared out to make room, says Regina Novickis, consumer expert with Slickdeals.net, a Web site that rates deals and coupons.

Prepare a financial report for use in an official statement for bond issuance purposes Although school districts are a common type of government, they face a number of unique issues that make them distinct from states, cities, counties, or other local governmental entities.
Therefore, Financial Statements provide a basis for the investment decisions of potential investors. Financial Institutions (e.g. banks) use Financial Statements to decide whether to grant a loan or credit to a business. Financial institutions assess the financial health of a business to determine the probability of a bad loan.
With the incorporation of these changes, three categories of funds remain: 1  Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions are accounted for. 2  Proprietary funds are used to account for a government's ongoing organizations and activities that are similar to those often found in the private sector.
This reduces the number of funds presented on the face of the financial statements and directs the focus on the significant funds of the reporting entity. Major fund reporting is applied only to governmental (i.e., general, special revenue, debt service, capital projects, and permanent funds) and enterprise funds.
Specifically, the information provided by governments should contribute to accountability in the following areas: 1  Financial position and results of operations. 2  Actual financial results compared with adopted budgets. 3  Compliance with finance-related laws, rules and regulations. 4  Efficiency and effectiveness of operations.
In addition, school-level financial information is often related to non-financial information (e.g., student achievement) in published reports and is used for comparison purposes. As a result, school districts must increasingly focus on ensuring that financial information reported by schools is accurate and consistent across the district.
Pregnant women can have some light irregular bleeding during pregnancy, but it should not be like a ânormalâ period. Some women can confuse this for their period because often it can come right around the time she was expecting her normal period.The irregular bleeding or spotting that can occur during pregnancy is often a dark brown or a light pinkish color. It should not be enough bleeding to fill pads or tampons over a few days.If you are bleeding enough to fill pads and tampons, then this would be a good indication that you are probably not pregnant. negative result can mean that you are not pregnant, you took the test too early, or you took the test wrong. Pregnancy tests vary in their sensitivity (how soon they can detect the hormone hCG), and you may not have given your body enough time to produce enough hCG hormones that will show up on the test.
Miscarriage-About 20-30% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Bleeding or spotting can be an early sign of miscarriage. Bleeding or spotting during pregnancy does not always mean that the woman will not go on to have a healthy pregnancy but it is reason for concern.A miscarriage often starts with light spotting that turns to heavy bleeding.wenty to twenty-five percent of women have bleeding or spotting during pregnancy. The bleeding is generally not as heavy a regular period. However, if a woman did not know that she was pregnant, she may assume the bleeding was just a light period.
The BabyCenter Editorial Team. No. You can't have your menstrual period while you're pregnant. Some women do have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Some even report intermittent bleeding that seems like a regular period to them.But vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is not the same thing as menstruation.he BabyCenter Editorial Team.

1 No. You can not and will not have a period during pregnancy. 2  There may be spotting which may last 1-4 days and is normal for your first child or your fifth. 3  It does not matter. 4  If you think you are pregnant and have spotting then wait a week and test. A period is to drain your menstrual blood, lining and eggs, which in pregnancy are needed to protect the fertilized egg or eggs. 2  So there for you CAN NOT be pregnant and have your period. 3  I'll explain why some women THINK they are on their period.
It is very possible and quite normal to have some 'bleeding' early in pregnancy. I had a very good friend who was 6 1/2 months pregnant before she found out because she was having normal 'periods' (she was heavy set which was why she didn't notice any weight gain or other symptoms).est Answer: You can have bleeding, but not an actual period. Women mistakanly call the bleeding a period when it's not. A period is the disposal of the unused egg and uterus lining.
1 You can have light bleeding during pregnancy and spotting yes. 2  A normal heavy flow period is very unlikely during pregnancy but it does happen with some women. 3  Yes, but it is not called a period. 4  There is a technical term used for the bleeding during pregnancy.

1 Anywhere from 5 - 15 days after the egg is fertilized, some women notice bleeding spotting which they confuse with a period. 2  In normal cases the bleeding is much lighter than a period and only last 2-4 days. 3  So all in all, if someone tells you that you can be pregnant, and have your period, they're wrong.

1 Possibly the first cloned mammal was a mouse in 1986, in the Soviet Union. 2  However, the cloning was done from an embryo cell, while the sheep Dolly in 1996 was cloned from an adult cell.
Scientists had cloned endangered species before, but not one that had officially died out. (Related: Scientists Clone First Endangered Species: A Wild Sheep [October 29, 2001].).
Dolly was the first clone produced from a cell taken from an adult mammal. The production of Dolly showed that genes in the nucleus of such a mature differentiated somatic cell are still capable of reverting to an embryonic totipotent state, creating a cell that can then go on to develop into any part of an animal.
1 However, the cloning was done from an embryo cell, while the sheep Dolly in 1996 was cloned from an adult cell. 2  The first mouse from adult cells, Cumulina, was born in 1997 at the University of Hawai'i at MÄnoa in the laboratory of Ryuzo Yanagimachi using the Honolulu technique.
1 Gene, the first cloned calf in the world was born on February 7, 1997 at the American Breeders Service facilities in Deforest, Wisconsin, USA. 2  Later it was transferred and kept at the Minnesota Zoo Education Center. 3  Three more cloned calves were born in 1998.
A species of wild cattle, the first endangered species to be cloned. In 2001 at the Trans Ova Genetics in Sioux Center, Iowa, USA, a cloned Gaur was born from a surrogate domestic cow mother. However, the calf died within 48 hours.
An extinct animal has been resurrected by cloning for the first timeâthough the clone died minutes after birth. Findings revealed January 23 in the journal Theriogenology describe the use of frozen skin in 2003 to clone a bucardo, or Pyrenean ibex, a subspecies of Spanish ibex that went extinct in 2000.

Dolly was remarkable in being the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell. This was a major scientific achievement as it demonstrated that the DNA from adult cells, despite having specialised as one particular type of cell, can be used to create an entire organism.
Dolly the sheep, as the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell, is by far the world's most famous clone. However, cloning has existed in nature since the dawn of life. From asexual bacteria to âvirgin birthsâ in aphids, clones are all around us and are fundamentally no different to other organisms.
How Dolly was cloned. Animal cloning from an adult cell is much more difficult than from an embryonic cell. So when scientists working at the Roslin Institute in Scotland produced Dolly, the only lamb born from 277 attempts, it was a major news story around the world.
Weil is less enthusiastic about white, or button, mushrooms, a species of mushroom that also includes Portobellos and criminis. âButton mushrooms do possess some health benefits, but not the general health benefits found in Asian mushrooms,â Weil says. Weil also says that these commonly available mushrooms contain natural substances called agaritines, which studies show may increase the risk of tumors in animals.
Andrew Weil, MD, is a huge fan of mushrooms. A longtime mushroom hunter, he seeks them out because of their taste and health benefits. And Weil, founder and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, likes to share his enthusiasm for these fungi.
In fact, as the authors of a recent Nutrition Today article noted, mushroomsâ nutrient and culinary characteristics suggest it may be time to re-evaluate food groupings and health benefits in the context of three separate food kingdoms: plants/ botany; animals/zoology and fungi/mycology.
For thousands of years, Eastern cultures have revered mushroomsâ health benefits.1 Mushrooms have long been celebrated as a source of powerful nutrients, but they can also help Americans meet the dietary recommendations set forth in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicineâs Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D.
For the maximum health benefits of mushrooms, I strongly advise against eating these or any other types of mushrooms raw, whether theyâre wild or cultivated. If youâre going to eat them cook them well, at high temperatures, by sauteeing, broiling, or grilling. Heat breaks down many of the toxic constituents.
Health Benefits of Portobello Mushrooms. Of the 140,000 fungi known to produce mushrooms, only about 100 of them are being investigated for possible health-promoting benefits.
You can buy dried, ground mushrooms and use them to make tea if you donât mind the bitterness. Otherwise, buy reishi tablets, liquid extracts or capsules, which are available online and in health food stores and follow the recommended dosage. Take reishi every day for at least two months to see what it can do for you.
Mushrooms are a good source of B vitamins, including riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid, which help to provide energy by breaking down proteins, fats and carbohydrates2. B vitamins also play an important role in the nervous system.
ââ¦Mushroomsâ nutrient and culinary characteristics suggest it may be time to reevaluate food groupings and health benefits in the context of 3 separate food kingdoms: plants/botany, animals/zoology, and fungi/mycology.
Procedures: 1  Clean mushrooms with a damp cloth and remove the stems. 2  In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, water, honey, garlic, cayenne pepper, and olive oil and drizzle it over the mushrooms. 3  Prepare a charcoal grill, gas grill, or broiler to medium heat.
Approximately 100 types of human papillomavirus infection (HPV) have been identified, at least 40 of which can infect the genital area (758). Most HPV infections are self-limited and are asymptomatic or unrecognized. Most sexually active persons become infected with HPV at least once in their lifetime (533,759).
Vaccines: Prevention, not a Cure. While the type of HPV that causes genital warts is consider âlow risk,â there are other HPV types referred to as âhigh-risk,â as infection with these types can lead to the development of cervical cancer.
HPV Treatment. There is no cure for human papillomavirus (HPV). However, there is treatment for the changes the virus can cause to the cervix, as well as treatment for the warts that can occur with an infection (both genital and nongenital).
HPV (human papillomavirus) is a sexually transmitted virus. It is passed on through genital contact (such as vaginal and anal sex). It is also passed on by skin-to-skin contact. At least 50% of people who have had sex will have HPV at some time in their lives. HPV is not a new virus.
When the HPV infection does not clear, genital warts, precancers, and cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, head, and neck might develop. The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.
Certain types of HPV infection cause cervical cancers. More than 100 varieties of human papillomavirus (HPV) exist. Different types of HPV infection cause warts on different parts of your body. For example, some types of HPV infection cause plantar warts on the feet, while others cause warts that mostly appear on the face or neck. Most HPV infections don't lead to cancer. But some types of genital HPV can cause cancer of the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina (cervix). Other types of cancers, including cancers of the anus, penis, vagina, vulva and back of the throat (oropharyngeal), have been linked to HPV infection.
There are over 100 different kinds of HPV and not all of them cause health problems. Some kinds of HPV may cause problems like genital warts. Some kinds of HPV can also cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, or anus. Most of these problems are caused by types 6, 11, 16 or 18.
A cure for HPV! Satisfaction guaranteed! No more outbreaks! If youâve had an HPV diagnosis, you may have seen claims like this in your search for information on the Internet and elsewhere, often written in large bold type.
Certain factors may affect the treatment for HPV that your healthcare provider recommends, including whether symptoms are present and what you want and expect. Treating HPV: An Overview. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an extremely common type of virus that infect humans.
This is why experts say there is no âcureâ for HPV, as the virus may still be present even though there are no signs of infection, like pre-cancerous lesions or genital warts. Some websites tout nutritional or herbal supplements that are claimed to either cure the virus or speed natural clearance.
Once in Law Land, one of the first (among many) perplexing metrics was law firm profitably. How could it be that on average the reported profits for the AmLaw 200 is 36.5% (median of 35.0%) â even after The Great Reset? There were even some firms reporting profits in the 60% range.
Average receipts per lawyer reported by participating firms totaled. $432,242, representing a decrease of 4% from the prior year. Overhead expenses. also decreased by 4% from the prior year to $161,904 per lawyer which, when. combined with the revenue decrease of 4%, had a net negative effect on law firm.
According to a 2014 Gartner Research study, âcompanies spent on average 10.2% of their annual 2014 revenue on overall marketing, with 50% of companies planning to increase [in 2015] to an average of 10.4%.â Ten percent â the magic number you will likely hear whenever you ask how much of your revenue you should spend on marketing.
In general, pricing ranges from a low of 75% of sales for firms. under $50K in revenue to 130% for larger firms in excess of $1M in sales.. SDE should be 40% to 60% of gross revenue. The higher the percent of SDE, the more valuable the practice. Other important.
All figures are pre-tax profit as a percentage of revenue. We chose this metric as it seems most directly comparable to what Law Land figures since, as we all know, law firms themselves pay no taxes: Johnson + Johnson: 21.0%. Colgate: 20.5%.
For example, a firm of three partners may determine that each will share in the net profit by allocating 45 percent, 30 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The gross fees collected total $650,000; with overhead at 42 percent, the net profit to be distributed is $377,000.
2012 Survey of Law Firm Economics Executive Summary, Page 7. The average amount of unbilled time for non-contingent fee matters per. lawyer for all participating law firms is $54,404, and the average for all size law. firms fluctuates in a narrow range between $46,000 and $68,000.
And they believe in what they are selling. Just take a look at their numbers. Salesforce invests 53% of their revenue into sales and marketing! 53%! Think about that for a minute. Thatâs just over half of the $4.1 billion in revenue generated in 2014.
For instance, in the firm of A,B & C, A may have 40 units, B may have 35 units and C may have 25 units. A will receive 40/100ths of net profit. B will receive 35/100ths and C will receive 25/100ths. The following year, the allocations of B and C are increased: A receives 40 units, B 40 units and C 30 units.
Those with 76 to 150 lawyers saw revenue. per lawyer decline by 10 percent. For firms of 150 lawyers or more, the drop was 9. percent. At the other end of the size spectrum, firms of one to nine lawyers. experienced a sharp 17 percent drop in RPL.
Most of the stretches you see and do are likely static-passive stretches. Static-passive stretches are the most common stretches and the easiest to perform. If executed with good technique, these stretches are effective in improving flexibility and range of motion.
1. Straight Legged Toe Touches. This stretch calls for keeping your legs straight while you bend over and touch your toes, with a bent spine. Stretching in this manner can be dangerous. Straight legged toe touches encourage hyperextension of the knees, which occurs when ligaments become stretches, and can lead to knee injury.
Stretching to prevent soreness. If you spend 15 minutes stretching in the hopes of preventing post-workout soreness, you may be wasting your time. Stretching before exercise doesn't do anything to lessen muscle soreness, finds a BMJ study.
5 Stretches You Should Never Do. gettyimages-537332564-jaaakworks-opener.jpg. There's a lot to like about stretching. Whether it's a little morning yoga to wake you up, or simple stretches to calm your nerve pain, stretching is beneficial in countless ways.
Although the benefits of stretching are many, is not for everyone. People who have suffered an acute muscle strain should avoid placing further stress on the muscle through stretching activities. The injured muscle should be given time to rest. Stretching muscle fibers in the acute period can result in further injury.
Static stretching means a stretch is held in a challenging but comfortable position for a period of time, usually somewhere between 10 to 30 seconds. Static stretching is the most common form of stretching found in general fitness and is considered safe and effective for improving overall flexibility.
Prolonged stretchingâor more than 60 seconds per muscle groupâcould decrease performance before some activities, says David Behm, PhD, a professor of human kinetics at Canada's Memorial University. Here are five stretches you should reconsiderâor avoid altogether.
Physical Therapy. Stretching is the deliberate lengthening of muscles in order to increase muscle flexibility and joint range of motion. Stretching activities are an important part of any exercise or rehabilitation program. They help warm the body up prior to activity thus decreasing the risk of injury as well as muscle soreness.
This is an excerpt from Full-Body Flexibility, Second Edition by Jay Blahnik. Stretching Techniques and Terms. First letâs review a few important techniques and terms. Even if youâre familiar with stretching, itâs a good idea to double-check your knowledge of this information.
6 Risky Stretches to Avoid. Stretches can help prevent muscle soreness and reduce your risk of injury; they can also improve overall flexibility, decrease your post workout recovery time and improve posture and balance.

Island County is less diverse than Washington state as a whole in terms of race and ethnicity. In 2014, 86.3 percent of the Island County population was white compared with 80.7 percent at the state level.
However, that is counterbalanced by Long Island being far more out into the ocean than Whidbey Island, trapped far inland in Puget Sound. Long Island Sound is far wider than Possesion Sound, too. One superlative remains: Whidbey Island is indeed the longest island on the Pacific coast of the contiguous United States. This is mainly due to lack of competition from the almost island-free coasts of California and Oregon, though.

This caused him a lot of pain, and none of the dentists he went to knew what to do besides take them out. Slowly but surely all of Washington's teeth were extracted. In 1772 Dr. Baker of Philadelphia extracted several. Finally, George had to have false teeth made. They were made out of hippopotamus ivory and cow's tooth, carved by hand, and held in his mouth with metal springs.
Of all the founding fathers, he was the most athletic, the most adventurous and clearly a man of action, Rees said. Washington, contrary to his grim-faced portrait on the dollar bill, was a great dancer and horseman. He started losing his teeth in his 20s.
Nevertheless, by the time he was inaugurated as president in 1789, Washington only had a single natural tooth left. He took the oath of office while wearing a special set of dentures made from ivory, brass and gold built for him by dentist John Greenwood.
He had false teeth, but they were not made of wood. As a matter of fact, the materials used in his false teeth were probably more uncomfortable than wood. They were made of cow's teeth, human teeth, and elephant ivory set in a lead base with springs that allowed him to open and close his mouth. They fit poorly and distorted the shape of his mouth. Throughout most of George Washington's life he had problems of continuing deterioration of his teeth.
The famous claim that George Washington sported a set of wooden teeth is little more than a myth, but Americaâs first president was certainly not a shining example of oral hygiene. Dental issues plagued Washington for most of his adult life.
At age 57, he will be shown being sworn in for his first term as president. Jed Kirschbaum / The Baltimore Sun. Scott Swank, DDS, Curator of The National Museum of Dentistry readies a George Washington denture for laser scanning.
Though Washingtonâs dentures were fashioned by some of the best dentists the late 18th century had to offer, they still left him disfigured and often in pain. Keeping his false teeth looking pearly white was a constant chore, and Washington often shipped them off to Greenwood to keep them in working order.
He began losing teeth as early as his twenties, and was eventually forced to wear several sets of unsightly and painful dentures. Rather than wood, Washingtonâs many false choppers were made out of varying combinations of rare hippopotamus ivory, human teeth and metal fasteners.
BALTIMORE â Researchers hoping to dispel George Washington's image as a stiff-jawed, boring old man are taking a bite out of history through a high-tech study of his famous false teeth.
The researchers were in Baltimore on Tuesday to perform laser scans on a set of Washington's dentures at the National Museum of Dentistry â dentures, they say, that were not made of wood as commonly believed.

While models that trim fees down to $100 or $200 per month may make concierge medicine affordable for the middle class (thatâs less than what many people shell out every month for Starbucks coffee, he points out), itâs unclear how much better care a physician could offer concierge patients on top of a full practice.
For anyone who has ever waited days or weeks to see the doctor, concierge medicine sounds appealing: For an additional fee, patients typically enjoy same-day appointments and 24-hour access, more face time with the doctor and extra preventative care.
Depending upon the services, fees range from as little as $60 per year up to $30,000 per year. The majority of patients still carry health insurance to pay for specialized services that their concierge doctor is unable to provide.
1 Mileage fees if the concierge drives his or her vehicle to run an errand*. 2  Errand running fees for when the concierge goes off site to fulfill a request. 3  Emergency service fees if an employee needs immediate assistance.  Use of preferred vendors who provide kickbacks to the concierge.
For this type of service, the fee structure is different. The services are typically paid for by the organization so they are a true benefit for employees. The organization contracts with the concierge service provider to serve employees.
The essence of the concierge job is to provide service. A hotel concierge is there to ensure that guests have everything they need during their stay. Typically, the concierge sits at a desk in the lobby, and guests can either stop by or call with their requests. Those requests may include:
The Academy estimates there are about 3,500 concierge doctors nationwide, up from about 2,400 just 18 months ago. It expects the number to double every 12 to 18 months for the next three years. Concierge medicine comes in many different forms, according to Tom Blue, the Academyâs executive director.

Typically, the concierge sits at a desk in the lobby, and guests can either stop by or call with their requests. In the next section, we'll look at personal concierges.
One of the most common kinds of concierge services are those that come with cardholder benefits. Many credit card companies like American Express or MasterCard offer the help of a concierge to those who are cardholders. You can dial a call center and request assistance to get tickets to an event or show, dinner reservations or travel accommodations.
One of those physicians is Steven D. Knope, a concierge physician in Tucson, Ariz., who runs a full-retainer practice that is âcompletely off the gridâ of third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid and insurers. He charges an annual fee of $6,000 per individual or $10,000 per couple for full services.

Anonymous said... Sapporo Ichiban is great. The person who started this thread by saying it wasn't authentic hasn't been there for a DECADE! (He said he last went in 2002, for god's sake). I've been with friends who have been to Japan and they seemed to think the food was perfectly fine and certainly not 'inauthentic'. I really liked it.
Sally said... I'm a big fan of Sapporo and I love Japanese food. It's run by chinese staff but they do great bento boxes, their Chicken Kara-age is wonderful. I love their Catford roll which is basically a good prawn tempura roll. I think Headhunter should try a repeat visit.
If by noodle bars you mean ramen places (as in noodles in soup), then Wagamama is not authentic. Ramen places in Japan are usually fairly down at heel, street corner type places along the lines of a local caff in London serving fish and chips, jellied eels and shepherds pie. None of the trendy flashiness of Wagamama.

The vast majority of the roughly 200 species of owls are so-called true owls, which possess large heads with round faces, short tails, and muted feathers with mottled patterns. The remainder, accounting for a little over a dozen species, are barn owls, which can be distinguished by their heart-shaped faces, long legs equipped with powerful talons, and moderate size.
On the following slides, you'll discover 10 essential owl facts, ranging from how these predatory birds hunt to how smart they actually are. 02. of 11.
Owl Song. Who, who, who are you, the owl seems to say. Who, who, who are you, heâs asking every day . Owl I have some questions for you. Where do you live and why do you âhoo?â What do you eat and when do you sleep? Yes, I have questions too . Who, who, who are you? (inst. Children can make âhooâ sounds) Who, who, who are you? (inst. Children can make âhooâ sounds) Owl I have some questions for you
So I was thinking- who better to help clarify the question (no pun intended), than the questioning owl? Read the activities below, and use the ones that fit the ages you work with. I receive many e-mails from ESL teachers around the world, and my hope is that this will also be a useful song for you in teaching those pesky interrogative pronouns (better known to us laymen as the five Wâs: who, what, when, where, why).
For one thing, owls will only eat fresh food, meaning you have to maintain a constant supply of mice, gerbils, rabbits, and other small mammals; for another, the beaks and talons of owls are very sharp, so you'll also have to keep a ready stock of band-aids; and as if all that weren't enough, an owl can live for more than 30 years, so you'll be donning your industrial-strength gloves and flinging gerbils into its cage well into late middle age.

With the exception of the common barn owlâwhich has a worldwide distributionâthe most familiar owls, at least to residents of North America and Eurasia, are the true owls. 02 of 10
This cute craft is also a clever get-to-know-you activity! This activity is appropriate for: preschool - 3rd grade / 3 - 8 years. You will need: Owl body and wings template; Owl feet and beak template; Owl eyes template; Construction Paper - 9 x 12 (brown, orange and white) Safety Scissors; Lakeshore Glue Sticks; Brass fasteners (two per student)
Basically, people think owls are smart for the same reason they think all kids who wear glasses are smart: bigger-than-usual eyes convey the impression of high intelligence. (This isn't to say that owls are especially dumb, either; you need lots of brain power to successfully hunt at night!)

Though we did not rank airports by this means, we did include the figures for total passengers in the countdown just to illustrate the relatioship between area and traffic. You will see that busyness and size do not always correlate, and biggest airports in the world arenât necessarily the busiest.

Find out some fun and intriguing facts about this species of aquatic amphibians. 1  Japanese firebelly newts have been observed to reproduce their eye-lenses for about 18 times in a span of 16 years.
Newts lay their eggs in freshwater. They prefer still water and generally donât use streams and rivers as the eggs can wash away. They may use canals or pockets at the sides of slow-flowing streams. Newts depend on broad-leaved vegetation on which to lay their eggs and prefer fish-free ponds.
The absolute aquatic Newts dwell in water, permanently. The semi-aquatic ones inhabit marshy areas having giddy atmosphere and easy access to water bodies nearby. They can be traced in gardens and parks with ponds or lakes close by.

Most premature babies who are born between 32 and 37 weeks do well after birth. If your baby does well after birth, his or her risk of disability is low. Babies most likely to have long-term disability are those who are born before 26 weeks or who are very small, 2.2 lb (1000 g) or less.
Parenting in the NICU. A stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a key part of many premature babies' recoveries. But for parents, this busy, unfamiliar place can be intimidating. Ease your fears by learning exactly what to expect â from tests and treatments your baby will receive to how you can help.
The duration of a pregnancy is measured by gestational age (or the amount of time elapsed since the first day of the last menstrual period). A normal gestation lasts 40 weeks or 279 days. If delivery occurs before 37 weeks gestation, the baby is considered prematurely born.
Babies born early have their own set of challenges to face. And if you're parenting a preemie, you'll need specialized information on your baby's health, development, feeding, and care. You'll find all of that here, including our articles on premature babies and expert content from March of Dimes.
Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks. A baby born 3 or more weeks early is premature. Babies who are born closer to their due dates tend to have fewer problems than babies born earlier. But even those who are born late preterm (closer to 37 weeks) are at risk for problems. Doctors and nurses often call premature babies preemies..
They can move more, although their movements may be jerky. A baby born at this time can grasp a finger. These babies can open their eyes, and they begin to stay awake and alert for short periods. Babies born at 28 to 31 weeks are at risk for medical complications. However, when complications occur, they may not be as severe as those of babies born earlier.
Article Body. Premature birth occurs in about 11 to 13 percent of pregnancies in the US. Almost 60 percent of twins, triplets, and other multiple deliveries result in preterm births. A birth is considered âpretermâ when a child is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy have been completed. Featured Article.
Your preemie's special challenges. A premature or preterm baby is born before 37 complete weeks of pregnancy. Generally, the earlier a baby is born, the higher the risk of complications. At first, your premature baby might have little body fat and need help maintaining body heat. He or she might cry only softly and have trouble breathing. Feeding your preemie might be a challenge.
Taking care of your preemie. Your preemie's special needs call for special care, probably in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In some cases, a premature baby needs to be transported to a hospital that can provide specialized care.
Understanding Birth Weight. Birth weight can also indicate whether a baby is born prematurely. Babies born with a weight of less than 2,500 grams (about five and one-half pounds) are considered to have low birth weight. Generally, infants with a birth weight less than 2,500 grams are premature.

1 doctor agreed: Rest, meds: There is not much you can do for bruised ribs you will need to rest until symptoms resolve and nsaids may help. Its good to get an xray to make sure you don't have a fracture which will obviously take 6-8 weeks to heal. ...Read more.
Formerly NattyBoh74... yeah ribs are a b itch. they can hurt for months. and then when you think the pain is gone, you take a deep breath in and here comes the sharp pains again. rib injuries suck bad. Sore Ribs I am going on my fourth week of sore ribs after a hard fall. Of course I could have done things to improve the healing time ( like not repeating the fall three days after the original injury on a night ride) like ice ibupofrin. I took five days off the bike after that.
April 19, 2012. You have 24 ribs (seven sets) that protect your internal organs and help you breathe. A direct blow to the chest can cause ribs to bruise, break, or separate from the breastbone. While bruised ribs are extremely painful, in most cases they heal completely. Medioimages/Photodisc / Thinkstock.
I'm going on 3 months and still have pain when lying down but it's gradually getting better. I was riding again (carefully) within a week and after about a month my ribs didn't really interfere with anything I did (except for lying down). 11-30-2006 #6.
Actually I wasn't posting for advice so much as asking if anyone with experience of a damaged rib could tell me how long I should expect it to take to heal. I have received some helpful advice, though, thanks EI, I will look up an osteo person and let you know how I get on! Sep 16, 2012. #10.
In brief: Depends. It depends on the severity and whether there is a fracture involved, but it could be 6-8 weeks. In brief: Depends. It depends on the severity and whether there is a fracture involved, but it could be 6-8 weeks.
Broken or bruised ribs. Introduction. Broken (fractured) or bruised ribs are usually caused by a fall or blow to the chest, or occasionally by severe coughing. They can be very painful, but will normally improve within about three to six weeks. If you think you've injured your ribs, you'll often be able to look after yourself at home.
The normal healing time for rib fractures/cracks is usually stated at a minimum of 6 weeks to a maximum of 6 months. Much depends on the general health of the person and specifically of their bones. Is it possible this person has osteoporosis or osteopenia?
Quick Answer. It takes up to 3 to 6 weeks for a bruised rib to get better, as stated by the National Health Service. A person can use painkillers to treat the condition and an X-ray may not be necessary. However, injuries sustained from car accidents, fall from heights and crashes need medical attention.

How long for a cracked / bruised rib to heal? Discussion in 'Health and wellbeing' started by rustybug, Sep 15, 2012. Nearly 3 weeks ago I was knocked over very hard by a heavy dog running fast. My feet left the ground and I came down on the top left quarter of my back. I felt like I'd possibly cracked or bruised a rib - it hurt like crazy to breathe deeply, and sneezing made me actually almost cry.
Part 2 of 3: Looking After a Moderately Sprained Wrist. 1. Take an over-the-counter medication. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with significant pain or inflammation in your wrist.
A sprained wrist is an injury to the ligaments that connect the small bones of the wrist (called carpal bones) together. The most common ligament injured in the wrist is the scapho-lunate ligament, which connects the scaphoid bone to the lunate bone.
DESCRIPTION. A sprain is an injury to a ligament. Ligaments are the connective tissues that connect bones to bones; they could be thought of as tape that holds the bones together at a joint (see Figure 1). The most common ligament to be injured in the wrist is the scapho-lunate ligament (see Figure 2). It is the ligament between two of the small bones in the wrist, the scaphoid bone and the lunate bone. There are many other ligaments in the wrist, but they are less frequently injured. Sprains can have a wide range of severity; minor sprains may have minimal stretch of the ligaments, and more severe sprains may represent complete tears of the ligament(s).
Wrist sprains have a wide range of severity depending on the degree of stretch or tearing to the ligament. The severity of your wrist sprain will dictate how you look after it at home or whether you need to see a health professional.
Sprained wrist symptoms. Symptoms of a wrist sprain vary depending on the extent of the injury and the location of the sprain. Sudden pain in the wrist will be felt at the time of injury and in more severe wrist sprains a tearing or popping feeling may be felt.
2. Ice your sprained wrist. The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries, including wrist sprains. Apply the ice to the most tender part of your wrist in order to reduce the swelling and pain.
In order to heal a sprained wrist quickly, you must follow the RICE principle for sprains -- rest, ice, compression and elevation -- to facilitate healing so you can get back in the game again. Visit your doctor so she can look at the sprain and analyze its severity.
Wrist sprain explained. A wrist sprain is quite a common injury, which usually occurs after a fall onto an outstretched hand. Other accidents or impacts can cause a sprained wrist, although it usually involves the wrist being bent either forwards or back. A sprained wrist doesn't usually occur as an overuse injury.
Rest and immobilize your wrist for faster healing. A sprained wrist is a common fall-related injury, since you instinctively extend your hand and often land with your weight on your wrist. If you're an athlete, a sprained wrist can put a major wrench in your plans when you're taken out of the game for a few weeks.
Wrist sprains can vary in severity. A mild or grade 1 wrist sprain may involve the ligament being stretched. Moderate or grade 2 injuries are partial tears of a ligament and severe grade 3 injuries are full ruptures of one or more ligaments. Grade 3 injuries may also involve an avulsion fracture where a fragment of bone is pulled off with the ligament.
The Glycemic Index (GI) refers to the effect carbohydrates have on blood glucose. If the carbohydrate increases blood glucose by a large amount, it is considered a high glycemic index food.If, on the other hand, it increases blood glucose a small amount, it is a low glycemic index food.A carbohydrate's GI is determined by its rate of digestion and absorption in the body.For example, foods that have a high degree of soluble fiber, such as whole grains, have lower GI values.f the carbohydrate increases blood glucose by a large amount, it is considered a high glycemic index food. If, on the other hand, it increases blood glucose a small amount, it is a low glycemic index food.
The Glycemic Index âor GI, for shortâis a system that ranks foods by how they affect your blood sugar levels. Low-glycemic index foods (less than 55) produce a gradual rise in blood sugar levels that's easy on the body.Foods between 55 and 70 are intermediate-glycemic index foods.Foods with high-glycemic index numbers (more than 70) make blood sugar levels as well as insulin levels spike fast. We now realize that's a health threat.oods between 55 and 70 are intermediate-glycemic index foods. Foods with high-glycemic index numbers (more than 70) make blood sugar levels as well as insulin levels spike fast.
The Glycemic Index: High GI vs Low GI. The glycemic index classifies carbs based on how quickly and how high they raise blood sugar levels when compared to pure glucose (sugar), although white bread is now used as the reference food in its place.ome common foods with a high GI rating include white bread, white rice, corn flakes, crackers and most sugary and/or highly processed snack foods. A carbohydrate with a low glycemic index (low GI) breaks down more slowly therefore causing a much slower and more gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream.
Not all Carbohydrate foods are equal. The Glycemic Index (GI) is a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.Carbohydrates with a low GI value (55 or less) are more slowly digested, absorbed and metabolised and cause a lower and slower rise in blood glucose and, therefore insulin levels.ï»¿ot all Carbohydrate foods are equal. The Glycemic Index (GI) is a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.
Quite simply: A carbohydrate with a high glycemic index (high GI) breaks down quickly during digestion and therefore releases glucose into the bloodstream rapidly. Some common foods with a high GI rating include white bread, white rice, corn flakes, crackers and most sugary and/or highly processed snack foods.A carbohydrate with a low glycemic index (low GI) breaks down more slowly therefore causing a much slower and more gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream.ome common foods with a high GI rating include white bread, white rice, corn flakes, crackers and most sugary and/or highly processed snack foods. A carbohydrate with a low glycemic index (low GI) breaks down more slowly therefore causing a much slower and more gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream.
Purpose. The purpose of a glycemic index (GI) diet is to eat carbohydrate-containing foods that are less likely to cause large increases in blood sugar levels. The diet is a means to lose weight and prevent chronic diseases related to obesity such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. glycemic index diet is an eating plan based on how foods affect your blood sugar level. The glycemic index is a system of assigning a number to carbohydrate-containing foods according to how much each food increases blood sugar.

Developed in 1981, the glycemic index reflects the extent to which carbohydrate-containing foods raise a personâs blood sugar and subsequent need for insulin. The idea is that low glycemic foods are better for health, warding off diabetes and weight gain, because the carbs they contain are digested at a slower rate.The dogma out there is that a high glycemic index is bad,â said Dr. Robert Eckel, a past president of the American Heart Association and a professor at the University of Colorado, who was not involved in the research. âI hope that ultimately the glycemic index will be left on the shelf.â.
Glycemic index is a number. It gives you an idea about how fast your body converts the carbs in a food into glucose. Two foods with the same amount of carbohydrates can have different glycemic index numbers. The smaller the number, the less impact the food has on your blood sugar. 1  55 or less = Low (good).2  56- 69 = Medium. 3  70 or higher = High (bad).ring down the overall glycemic index of a meal by combining a high-glycemic index food with foods that have lower ones. Your age, how active you are, and how fast you digest food also affect how your body reacts to carbs.
We refer to physical stressors--the tangible and measurable stressors -- as the tiger in your path: 1  accident/trauma. 2  alcohol in excess. 3  circadian light-dark cycle/rhythms. 4  food. 5  infection/virus. 6  injury. 7  medication. 8  seasonal change. 9  poison. 10  surgery. 11  temperature extremes. 12  tobacco. 13  toxin. 14  travel.
A general term for any factor that increases a personâs mental or physical stress; virtually all stressors can be described as related to environment (e.g., inadequate housing) or personal (e.g., health related, sexual, social or related to work).
Two broad categories of stressors. A stressor is anything that causes the release of stress hormones. There are two broad categories of stressors: Physiological (or physical) stressors and Psychological Stressors.
Psychological stress occurs when you are under pressure or having difficulty coping with a situation or stimulus. Think of it as your emotional response to stressful events. The anxiety and incompetence that you felt as a result of receiving a 'D' on your midterm exam is an example of psychological stress.
Stressor. A stimulus or event that provokes a stress response in an organism. Stressors can be categorized as acute or chronic, and as external or internal to the organism. Mentioned in: General Adaptation Syndrome.
In today's fast-paced world, women are experiencing more stress at every stage of their lives than ever before. Juggling job pressures, family schedules, money issues, career and educational advancement and child and eldercare concerns are only a few of the common stressors confronting women.
A HealthyWomen answered. Stressors are external events, including pressures in people's lives such as divorce, marriage, children, work and money. The experience of stress, however, is related to how you respond to these stressors. One person's stressor can be another person's motivator.
TIPS. An easy way to remember the difference between the two categories of stressor is that absolutely everyone exposed to an absolute stressor will find it stressful. For a relative stressor, situations are relatively stressful only for some.
Lesson Summary. Any event or stimulus that requires you to change in some way has the potential to cause stress. Psychological stress is what you feel when you are under pressure or having difficulty coping with a situation or stimulus. Psychological stressors are the things that cause psychological stress, and as far as we know, can only be experienced by human beings.

The National Center for Health Statistics reports that from 1975 to 1988 in the US, in families with children present, wives file for divorce in approximately two-thirds of cases. In 1975, 71.4% of the cases were filed by women, and in 1988, 65% were filed by women.
Colorado Ranks in Top 10 States for Divorce. Posted on Jan 29, 2015 2:59pm PST. In a recent article published by Westword, the top 10 states leading the way in divorce were ranked. Colorado made it on this list.
1. Crude Divorce Rate. This number refers to the number of divorces per 1,000 people in a population. The crude annual divorce rate is currently around 3.6 divorces for every 1,000 people in the US, regardless of age. The age-adjusted crude divorce rate is currently thirteen divorces for every 1,000 people age fifteen and older.
Clay roof tile has been used for centuries worldwide and for good reason. Both clay roof tile and its modern partner, concrete, are not only beautiful but also extremely durable. With proper building design and installation, tile roofs can last 50 to 100 years or more. They do not rot in wet climates and are not susceptible to destruction by pests. They can be used in any climate or region and can withstand the severest weather conditions, including fire, wind, and snow.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: About 15-20 years for the standard asphalt shingles. You can pay more to get some that are supposed to last longer though. I live in Florida too and we replaced our roof when it was about 16 1/2 years old. It also depends on if there is a lot of debris on your roof, or if you keep it cleaned off. If there is a lot of debris up there it keeps the shingles wet after it rains and they will deteriorate faster.
heres the honest answer: A 20 yr. asphault/fiberglass shingle in so. florida will last 12-14 years, i dosent matter where you live 20 yr, shingles doesnt last 20 years. A`30 year will not last 30 years. Go with a metal roof, more bang for the buck, lots if choices.
Roofs: Slate, copper and tile roofs can last more than 50 years. Homeowners with wood shake roofs should expect them to last about 30 years, while fiber cement shingles last about 25 years and asphalt shingle/composition roofs last about 20 years, the NAHB found. Climate and weather conditions, such as snow, hail and hurricanes, can cut the life span of all types of roofs.
Decks: Because of weather, the life span of a deck varies. In optimal conditions, a wood deck can last 20 years, the NAHB study found. A deck can last 20 to 25 years in dry areas, but is likely to last only 10 to 15 years in the South, where there is more rain and humidity.
Metal roofing materials can last for decades without degrading in appearance or function. The oldest metal roofs in the world are over 120 years old and are still in fairly good condition. Paint and anti-rust technologies increase a metal roofâs lifespan drastically and make metallic roofs an excellent long-term investment. Residential metal roofs typically have a rated lifespan of 50 years or more. This is outstanding compared to the 15-year average lifespan of other materials.
Metal Roof Lifespan. Ultimately, m etal roofs are excellent long-lasting options with excellent and low maintenance needs. When you buy a new metal roof, you will probably be buying the last roof that your home ever needs.
Floors: Wood floors last 100 years or more, as do marble and slate floors if they are maintained well. Tile floors can last 75 to 100 years, and terrazzo lasts more than 75 years. Linoleum lasts about 25 years and vinyl up to 50 years, while laminate floors have a life expectancy of 15 to 25 years. Most carpet needs to be replaced every eight to 10 years, even if itâs maintained well.
Metal roofing prices are fairly low, and many homeowners are considering metal roofs as a long-lasting, great-looking option that improves home energy consumption. If youâre considering metal roofing, you might wonder how long metal roofs last and what type of maintenance your new roof will require.
However, both concrete and clay tile outlast most other roofing materials, with manufacturers offering warranties of 50 years or more. In fact, in Asia and Europe, many structures with clay roof tiles have remained not simply intact but also functional and beautiful for centuries.

The Agaricus Blazei Murill Mushroom. Over 500,000 people have turned to the Agaricus blazei mushroom to support a healthy immune system in order to fight off minor and major health challenges.
Cultivation of Agaricus Blazei. This mushroom was first identified to modern science in 1917 from a specimen found in Louisiana by the mycologist R. Murrill. It has been found on the grasslands of Florida and South Carolina, but is generally thought to be extremely rare in nature.
This sounds far-fetched to me. Agaricus blazei, sometimes called Agaricus blazei Murrill, is a medicinal mushroom known in Japan as himematsutake; in Brazil, where much of the worldâs supply is grown, as cogumelo do sol or medicinel; and in the United States as the almond portobello or Royal Sun Agaricus.
The mushroom was found to be rich in immune-modulating substances such as Î²-glucans and proteoglycans, and presented anti-infection and anti-tumor effects in animal studies. Currently, Agaricus blazei Murill remains under intense investigation, and the results are published in major scientific journals.
â March 17, 2014. Agaricus blazei, sometimes called Agaricus blazei Murrill, is a medicinal mushroom known in Japan as himematsutake; in Brazil, where much of the worldâs supply is grown, as cogumelo do sol or medicinel; and in the United States as the almond portobello or Royal Sun Agaricus.
Why choose Atlas Worldâs Agaricus blazei. Atlas Worldâs patented strain of Agaricus blazei Murill (H1X1), was developed by expert mycologists. H1X1 is the product of two parent strains, one cultivated in northern California known as SBRFG, and another parent strain cultivated in Japan known as I-101.
Agaricus subrufescens forms fruitbodies singly or in clusters in leaf litter in rich soil, often in domestic habitats. Originally described from the northeastern United States and Canada, it has been found growing in California, Hawaii, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Philippines and Brazil.
Agaricus subrufescens (syn. Agaricus blazei, Agaricus brasiliensis or Agaricus rufotegulis) is a species of mushroom, commonly known as almond mushroom, mushroom of the sun, God's mushroom, mushroom of life, royal sun agaricus, jisongrong or himematsutake (Chinese: æä»æ¾è¸, Japanese: å§«ã¾ã¤ãã, princess matsutake) and by a number of other names.
The history of Agaricus blazei Murill is tightly linked to the mountain village Piedade, located within the Atlantic rain forest, about one hundred kilometers west of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Agaricus blazei Murill was originally found in Piedade, a small village located in the mountainous region of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Agaricus subrufescens was first described by the American botanist Charles Horton Peck in 1893. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was cultivated for the table in the eastern United States. It was discovered again in Brazil during the 1970s, and misidentified as Agaricus blazei Murrill, a species originally described from Florida.
Delivery When You Have Gestational Diabetes. When youâre delivering your baby, the doctor will watch your blood glucose level. If your level goes too high during labor, the baby may release more insulin in response. That increases the risk of the baby developing low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) after birth.
Gestational Diabetes. Abnormal maternal glucose regulation occurs in 3-10% of pregnancies, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which is defined as glucose intolerance of variable degree with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, accounts for 90% of cases of diabetes mellitus (DM) in pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes sometimes develops when a woman is pregnant. Itâs when the blood glucose level (blood sugar level) of the mother goes too high during pregnancy. Having an elevated blood glucose level during pregnancy can cause problems for your babyâif itâs left untreated.
High blood glucose, also called blood sugar, can harm your baby during the first weeks of pregnancy, even before you know you are pregnant. If you have diabetes and are already pregnant, see your doctor as soon as possible to make a plan to manage your diabetes.
Diabetes and Pregnancy. Diabetes is often diagnosed in women during their childbearing years and can affect the health of both the mother and her unborn child. Poor control of diabetes during pregnancy increases the chances for birth defects and other problems for the baby. It can cause serious complications for the woman, also.
Gestational diabetes happens when your body can't make enough insulin during pregnancy. Insulin is a hormone made in your pancreas, an organ located behind your stomach. Insulin helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels.
Without enough insulin, you can build up too much glucose in your blood, leading to a higher-than-normal blood glucose level and perhaps gestational diabetes. The elevated blood glucose level in gestational diabetes is caused by hormones released by the placenta during pregnancy.
Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops only during pregnancy. Diabetes means your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Your body uses glucose for energy. Too much glucose in your blood is not good for you or your baby. Gestational diabetes is usually diagnosed during late pregnancy.
Hormonal and other changes in your body during pregnancy affect your blood glucose levels, so you might need to change how you manage your diabetes. Even if youâve had diabetes for years, you may need to change your meal plan, physical activity routine, and medicines.
Pregnancy if You Have Diabetes. If you have diabetes and plan to have a baby, you should try to get your blood glucose levels close to your target range before you get pregnant. Staying in your target range during pregnancy, which may be different than when you arenât pregnant, is also important.
This occurs because you don't receive adequate stimulation to the bone without a tooth root. The same occurs with dentures that are not implant-supported. The longer you wait to get dental implants, the more likely it is that your jawbone may lack the integrity to get implants in the future without a dental bone graft. If you are in London and looking for a dental implant specialist then Pro Dental Clinic London is place best for you.
People get dental implants due to many reasons. A few of the reasons are given below: Better appearance. Though artificial, but dental implants look like your own teeth. They become permanent as they are designed in a way to get fuse with bone. Improve verbal communication.
Reasons to Consider Dental Implants as your Tooth Replacement Option:-. 1. Stop your teeth from shifting into the empty space - When you lose a tooth, the surrounding teeth will eventually begin moving to fill in the space. This can cause a number of dental complications.
A dental implant restores the lost tooth so that it looks same and functions like a natural tooth. It allows you to stop worry and enjoy life. Dr. Anil Yadav will explain why do people get dental implants. You can watch more content on Health related issues and also talk to the doctors and consult the doctor online on your phone only on SYMPLER.
If you need an MRI, you may first need a simple procedure to briefly take out the magnet in the cochlear implant. But more medical facilities can do these imaging tests without removing the magnet. Thereâs also a type of cochlear implant that has a magnet you don't need to take out in order to have an MRI.
How do I know if the implant is a good choice for me? If you have severe or profound hearing loss, a team of experts at a cochlear implant center can help you decide if the device and surgery will work for you.
As commonly, once a tooth is removed from the oral cavity, it canât be replaced naturally. So In dental implant mechanism, dentist place artificial tooth into the vacant oval cavity . If you want to read in detail about Dental Implants you may visit this page Dental Implants and Dental Care in Austin, TX .
If you're very hard of hearing or deaf, a cochlear implant may help you get back the sounds you miss. It isn't a hearing aid, which makes sounds louder. Itâs a small device that a doctor puts in your ear through surgery.

Asides, the cosmetic benefits of a dental implant, you get to smile more graciously. For aesthetic purpose. Dental implants add color to peopleâs face.
Some parts of the device can get damaged if they get wet. You need to take off the speech processor before you bathe, shower, or swim. You also can cover that part with a waterproof case or choose a waterproof cochlear implant processor.
Reference Range. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests are used to determine which specific antibiotics a particular bacteria or fungus is sensitive to. Most often, this testing complements a Gram stain and culture, the results of which are obtained much sooner. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests can guide the physician in drug choice and dosage for difficult-to-treat infections.
A culture that is reported as no growth in 24 or 48 hours usually indicates that there is no infection. If the symptoms persist, however, a urine culture may be repeated on another sample to look for the presence of bacteria at lower colony counts or other microorganisms that may cause these symptoms.
Culture and sensitivity, commonly abbreviated as C&S, is a laboratory test used to determine the presence and type of bacteria in an infection and determine the antibiotics most likely to be effective in killing the bacteria in the dog or other animal.
No. You have to take the specimen, take it to the lab, and in the lab they culture it, isolate it and tell you what the identity is based on a gram stain, morphology, biochemical profile (whether it produces oxygen or what) and so forth. Hereâs an actual clinical report with discussion below it.
The urine culture is used to diagnose a urinary tract infection (UTI) and to identify the bacteria or yeast causing the infection. It may be done in conjunction with susceptibility testing to determine which antibiotics will inhibit the growth of the microbe causing the infection.
The sample submitted for culture can be urine, blood, body fluids, pus, discharge or tissue. The sensitivity test follows the culture. Once the bacteria have been grown and isolated in a culture medium, they are tested against different antibiotics to determine which drug(s) is likely to be effective.
Culture and Sensitivity â âC & Sâ. Culture: You send a specimen to the lab and the labs job is to tell you what the organism is, a definitive ID based on gram stain, morphology and biochemical profile. Susceptibility: The lab also gives you the info on the antibiotic susceptibilities to know how to treat it.

After the culture (sample) is collected from a person, it is sent to a lab. There, the samples are put in special containers to grow the microorganisms (germs) from the collected samples.
Results of a urine culture are often interpreted in conjunction with the results of a urinalysis and with regard to how the sample was collected and whether symptoms are present.
Antibiotic sensitivity testing; Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. After the culture (sample) is collected from a person, it is sent to a lab.

Pseudomonas infection is caused by strains of bacteria found widely in the environment; the most common type causing infections in humans is called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infectious diseases, and nearly 10% of people will experience a UTI during their lifetime.
Bacteria, singular bacterium, Streptococcus pyogenesÂ© S. LowryâUniversity of UlsterâStone/Getty Imagesany of a group of microscopic single-celled organisms that live in enormous numbers in almost every environment on Earth, from deep-sea vents to deep below Earthâs surface to the digestive tracts of humans.
Members of these two prokaryotic domains are as different from one another as they are from eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells (i.e., Bacteria and Archaea) are fundamentally different from the eukaryotic cells that constitute other forms of life. Prokaryotic cells are defined by a much simpler design than is found in eukaryotic cells.
cell: typical cellsEncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.All living organisms on Earth are made up of one of two basic types of cells: eukaryotic cells, in which the genetic material is enclosed within a nuclear membrane, or prokaryotic cells, in which the genetic material is not separated from the rest of the cell.
Substantial portions of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) copy of the genetic information (deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) are discarded, and the remaining messenger RNA (mRNA) is substantially modified before it is translated into protein.
What types of infections does Pseudomonas aeruginosa cause? Serious Pseudomonas infections usually occur in people in the hospital and/or with weakened immune systems. Infections of the blood, pneumonia, and infections following surgery can lead to severe illness and death in these people. However, healthy people can also develop mild illnesses with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially after exposure to water.
A specimen was considered positive for UTI if a single organism was cultured at a concentration of â¥105 cfu/ml, or when a single organism was cultured at a concentration of 104 cfu/ml and â¥5 leukocytes per high-power field were observed on microscopic examination of the urine.
The results show that the antimicrobial resistance patterns of the causes of UTI are highly variable and continuous surveillance of trends in resistance patterns of uropathogens is important.
An accurate and prompt diagnosis of UTI is important in shortening the disease course and for preventing the ascent of the infection to the upper urinary tract and renal failure. 6. Treatment of UTI cases is often started empirically.

Most of the time, though, LDAP is used to search for information in the directory. The LDAP search operation allows some portion of the directory to be searched for entries that match some criteria specified by a search filter.
Global services are usually distributed, meaning that the data they contain is spread across many machines, all of which cooperate to provide the directory service. Typically a global service defines a uniform namespace which gives the same view of the data no matter where you are in relation to the data itself.

A directory is a specialized database specifically designed for searching and browsing, in additional to supporting basic lookup and update functions. Note: A directory is defined by some as merely a database optimized for read access.
OpenLDAP is a widely used LDAP server in Linux environments. It can do a lot of things for all sorts of needs. Whilst Samba, running in 'classic' mode, can use it as a storage backend for accounts and mappings from Windows (TM) SIDs to unix UID/GID, it cannot be used if Samba is running as an AD DC. OpenLDAP can also be used to control mail delivery and other things.

In a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found that the brains of autistic children showed differences in certain regions that normally develop in the second trimester of pregnancy.
After that, your appetite should return, and will probably grow. Although food is looking much more appetizing, be aware of how much you're eating. You only need about an extra 300 to 500 calories a day during the second trimester, and you should be gaining about 1/2 to 1 pound a week.
Pregnancy is typically broken into three periods, or trimesters, each of about three months. Each trimester is defined as 14 weeks, for a total duration of 42 weeks, although the average duration of pregnancy is 40 weeks.
The second trimester is, for many women, the easiest three months of pregnancy. Take the time now, while you're feeling better and your energy is up, to start planning for your baby's arrival. During the second trimester, your baby is growing quickly. Between your 18th and 22nd week of pregnancy you'll have an ultrasound so your doctor can see how your baby is progressing. You also can learn the sex of your baby, unless you'd rather be surprised.
Still, the trimesters of pregnancy can be a very useful âshorthandâ of sorts that we can use to talk about the symptoms and the progress of pregnancy. The first trimester starts with conception, and concludes roughly 13 or 14 weeks later. The second trimester begins when the first trimester of pregnancy ends. The second trimester of pregnancy begins at around 14 weeks of pregnancy. The second trimester will last for another 13 or 14 weeks, at which point the third trimester will begin. So, the second trimester encompasses the middle part of your pregnancy, and will lst from around the third month to around the sixth month of pregnancy.
Around the middle of the second trimester, movement of the fetus may be felt. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided high-quality medical care. The third trimester is from 29 weeks through 40 weeks. Prenatal care improves pregnancy outcomes.
Working with autopsy brains of 11 children with autism and 11 children without the disorder who were between the ages of two and 15 years, the scientists focused on 25 genes responsible for specific nerve cell types in the outer layer for the brain, whatâs known as the cortex.
The fertilized egg then travels down the fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus, where it begins to form the fetus and placenta. The first trimester carries the highest risk of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus). The second trimester is from week 13 through 28.
Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/ or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number.
A new report shows the brains of autistic children, who suffer from the disorder tied to a combination of contributing factors from genes to the environment, have differences in regions that develop during the mother's second trimester of pregnancy.
Plant cells have several structures not found in other eukaryotes. In particular, organelles called chloroplasts allow plants to capture the energy of the Sun in energy-rich molecules; cell walls allow plants to have rigid structures as varied as wood trunks and supple leaves; and vacuoles allow plant cells to change size.
Plant cells have high concentrations of molecules dissolved in their cytoplasm, which causes water to come into the cell under normal conditions and makes the cell's central vacuole swell and press against the cell wall. With a healthy supply of water, turgor pressure keeps a plant from wilting.
Plant cells have certain distinguishing features, including chloroplasts, cell walls, and intracellular vacuoles. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts; cell walls allow plants to have strong, upright structures; and vacuoles help regulate how cells handle water and storage of other molecules.
The biological membranes provide much of the functionality of the organisms of which they are a part. From intracellular organelles to extracellular cellâcell interactions, membranes provide the structures necessary for biological function and organisation. Many structural and functional features are common among membranes in archaea, bacteria, eukaryotic cells and enveloped viruses. The fundamental architecture of all biological membranes is built upon the lipid bilayer. Thus, all membranes have properties in common. Membrane proteins confer a myriad of specific functions expressed by cell membranes. Plasma membranes determine the cell boundary and the interactions of the cell with its environment. Intracellular membranes compartmentalise cells into different functional units with differing internal compositions.
The cell wall surrounds the plasma membrane of plant cells and provides tensile strength and protection against mechanical and osmotic stress. It also allows cells to develop turgor pressure, which is the pressure of the cell contents against the cell wall.
The Clydesdale is a draft horse breed from Lanarkshire, Scotland, and its name was inspired by the River Clyde. The Clydesdaleâs history goes back to the mid-1700s, when native stocks were mated with larger Flemish horses and then selected for use in agriculture and for all types of heavy hauling, including transport through the streets of Glasgow.

Characteristics and Origin of the Clydesdale Horse. The Clydesdale is a breed of heavy draft horse developed in and deriving its name from the district in Scotland where it was founded. Its type was evolved by the farmers of Lanarkshire, through which the River Clyde flows. The old name for Lanarkshire is Clydesdale.
Clydesdale horses were first exhibited under the breed name in 1826, and the breed was further standardized through the system of hiring out purebred stallions. The Clydesdale Horse Society was formed in 1877, and its breed registry records go back to the 1830s. The Clydesdale was first imported to North America in the 1840s. The breedâs attractiveness and size led to its use in promotional hitches, such as one sponsored by the Chicago Stockyard Company.

Meet the Clydesdale. The Clydesdale breed once almost faced extinction. Even though there is little practical use for heavy horses today because their muscle power has been replaced by machinery, breeders and enthusiasts have ensured that the breed is increasing, rather diminishing in numbers.
The Clydesdale was developed for both agricultural work and commercial transportation. In their early history, they were used as war horses, suited to carrying a heavily armed soldier. They were used to till fields, log, pull freight wagons, milk wagons, and general hauling.

Brewing is the production of beer by steeping a starch source (commonly cereal grains) in water and fermenting the resulting sweet liquid with yeast.hen the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank. Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate.
The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, able to be fermented (converted into alcohol); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring, such as hops, to offset the sweetness of the malt.hen the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank. Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate.
Malt can be further processed to produce liquid or dried sweeteners called Malt Extracts. There are several classes of Malt Extracts, including Standard Malt Extracts, Specialty and Black Malt Extracts, and Coextracts of Malt and Other Cereal Grains.Other unmalted grains or starch sources can be converted into extracts, using malted barley as a natural enzyme source in the extraction process. this is done most often for economy and, in some cases, to make a lighter flavored syrup.owever, similar to the term malt, the term malt extract unqualified refers to an extract of malted barley. According to CFR, an extract of 100% malted barley can also be referred to as malt syrup.
Most beer is fermented with a brewer's yeast and flavoured with hops. Secondary starch sources (adjuncts), such as maize (corn), rice, or sugar, may also be used. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava.The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.hen the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank.

The. , a stele bearing the most complete and perfect extant collection of Babylonian laws developed during the reign of Hammurabi (1792-1750 BCE), was discovered near the castle in 1901 by French Orientalist Jean-Vincent Scheil.
Hammurabi. (haemoÍorae`hÃ¤moÍorÃ¤) , bÄ. flâ1792 1750.B., c king Of Babylonia, babylonia ancient empire Of. Mesopotamia the name is sometimes given to the whole civilization Of S, mesopotamia including the states established by the city rulers Of, Lagash (akkad Or), Agade, uruk And ur in the 3d Millennium.B...... c
Hammurabiâs edicts were a fixture of the ancient world, but the laws were later lost to history and werenât rediscovered until 1901, when a team of French archeologists unearthed the famous diorite stele at the ancient city of Susa, Iran, once the seat of the Elamite Empire.
These famous pre-Biblical laws helped shape Babylonian life in Hammurabiâs time, but their influence would echo throughout the ancient world for over a millennia. Below, find out more about the fascinating history behind one of antiquityâs most important legal codes.
Itâs not the earliest known code of laws. Hammurabiâs dictates are often cited as the oldest written laws on record, but they were predated by at least two other ancient codes of conduct from the Middle East.
The Code includes one of the earliest examples of the presumption of innocence. While itâs notorious for its catalogue of barbaric punishments, Hammurabiâs Code also set several valuable legal precedents that have survived to this day.
In the 18th century B.C., the Babylonian King Hammurabi fashioned a compendium of 282 laws that set standards of conduct and justice for his empire in ancient Mesopotamia.
Although the Code of Hammurabi was essentially humanitarian in its intent and orientation, it contained the eye for an eye theory of punishment, which is a barbarian application of the concept of making the punishment fit the crime.
King of Babylonia (1792â1750. ). The ascendancy of Babylonia is associated with his name. An Amorite in origin, Hammurabi was a skillful politician and military leader.
The Code of Hammurabi was a comprehensive set of laws, considered by many scholars to be the oldest laws established; they were handed down four thousand years ago by King Hammurabi of Babylon.
Combination Drugs. Over-the-counter medications designed to treat multiple symptoms often contain painkillers in combination with other drugs. Cold and flu medications often contain painkillers as well as decongestants. And menstrual pain relievers often provide diuretics, too. I am not a big fan of combination drugs, Schmitz said.
Choosing a painkiller off the drug store shelf can be, well, painful. To offer some relief, Consumer Reports Health released its Best Buy Drugs -- a 22-page report that compares the effectiveness, safety and price of some of the top brands (and generics) for pain killing.
And if you use aspirin along with ibuprofen or naproxen, the risk to your stomach is even greater. Any of these pain drugs alone can cause ulcers, and using them together only increases the risk, says Glaser. All three of these medications reduce pain through their effects on the prostaglandin pathways..
Another NSAID, ibuprofen, has pain relieving effects similar to those of acetylsalicylic acid. But it tends to work better even at a lower dose and have milder side effects. It is a very good anti-inflammatory medication, originally developed to treat arthritis, said Duke's Collins.
This may also lead to localized muscle spasm and pain referred to other areas away from the injection site. Sometimes the original pain may return or occasionally get worse after a treatment. Notify the office only if your pain medication, anti-inflammatories, ice and/or heat are ineffective. MEDICATION POLICY: If appropriate, controlled medications (narcotics, relaxants, and sedatives) may be prescribed prior to discharge from your procedure. Prescribing controlled medications over the phone is avoided.
In most cases and when taken properly for pain, these drugs are very safe. That's why they're sold over-the-counter in the first place. But there are some situations where you can put yourself at risk by using these pain drugs improperly. Acetaminophen and Risk of Liver Damage. One of the most well-known risks of painkillers is liver damage from acetaminophen. Although [acetaminophen] has been used for years and overall is extremely safe, liver toxicity can occur with use of more than 4,000 milligrams in a day, says Dr. Glaser.
Clear liquids are allowed up to 3 hours before your appointment. (i.e. apple juice, water, coffee/tea without milk/cream).â¢ See attached blood thinner list for medications that need to be stopped prior to procedure.â¢ You must notify the physician prescribing the blood thinner before stopping them.
Always have assistance when walking up stairs, you may have numbness or weakness in the extremity related to the procedure, which could cause it to give out.DIET: Advance from clear liquids to your regular diet as tolerated.WOUND: Band-aids may be removed after 24 hours and do not need to be replaced.
The report focuses on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), which commonly are used to treat pain associated with arthritis. But NSAIDs are only one type of painkiller. Depending on the ache, another type might be better. And depending on the sufferer, some drugs can be dangerous.
In patients on blood thinners such as Coumadin or Plavix to prevent clots, these medications [NSAIDS and aspirin] can lead to the unintentional over-thinning of the blood and excessive risks of bleeding, Glaser says. Additionally, these NSAIDs have been shown to raise blood pressure.

With a staple down or nail down installation over a wood subfloor using solid flooring or engineered flooring, it is recommended that an underlayment of 15lb. black felt paper is rolled out over the wood subfloor prior to installing the new floor.
Your choice in underlay performs a few unglamorous, yet extremely important, functions after youâve laid down your solid hardwood floor, bamboo floors, engineered wood flooring, or laminate floor. Here are the 5 reasons you need underlay for your wood floor installation. Underlay evens out minor subfloor imperfections. An even subfloor is a key element to greater stability when it comes to your choice in wood flooring.
1 And a big part of that is a warm floor. A good underlay keeps the damp cold away from the floor board, and the resulting cold away from your feet.  Underlay aids in moisture resistance. This benefit is particularly true when you invest in an underlay with an attached vapor barrier.
In other words, laminate flooring is a floating floor. If the glue, adhesive, or thin set are used to attach the floor product to the sub floor, the underlayment serves different purposes when used under a laminate floor. 1. Padding or underlayment serves as noise reduction.
Hardwood, laminate, bamboo and vinyl flooring underlayment products help dampen sound, protect your floor from harmful moisture and provide thermal insulation.
1 And a big part of that is a warm floor. A good underlay keeps the damp cold away from the floor board, and the resulting cold away from your feet. And speaking of damp  â¦. Underlay aids in moisture resistance.
Underlayments play an important role during the installation of new hardwood flooring or laminate flooring. Whether you intend to staple down, nail down or float, an underlayment offers a slew of benefits during and after installation.
1 And stability, as you know, is what youâre after if you want your floor to last.  Underlay helps to reduce noise. One of the issues with laminate flooring, and other floating floors, is the noise of footfalls. This has improved as flooring products have evolved, of course.
We've found that the most popular are the 1/8 IN. thick cork underlayment (3mm) and the 1/4 IN. thick cork underlayment (6mm). The only difference is the thickness, the thicker 6 mm will give you twice the sound absorption if desired to lessen any noise when the floor is walked on.
Laminate Flooring with Underlayment Attached. Some manufacturers, like QuickStep and Alloc, make laminate flooring with an underlayment already attached to the back of each board. This makes installation quick and simple, negating the need to roll out a separate underlayment.

One of the biggest ones is in Scotland, reaching 177 ft. Measurement of Giant Sequoia Redwood tree sizes are based on height, girth at the ground and the volume. The tree called General Sherman has the biggest volume at 52,508 cubic ft. The tallest reaches a height of 311 ft (unnamed). The oldest are 3,500 years old and found in the Converse basin.
When speaking of Redwood tree sizes, one should distinguish between the two types. The Coast Redwood trees (Sequoia sempervirens) are the tallest on Earth (the highest reaches up to 379 ft). The Giant Sequoia or Sierra Redwood trees (Sequoiadendron giganeum) reach 290 ft (average) and have the biggest volume.
The tallest tree is Hyperion (in Redwood National Park) at 379.1 ft. Currently there are over 30 trees over 360 ft tall. There are over 150 trees over 350 ft tall. There are unconfirmed reports of a 380 ft tree that was chopped down in 1912. The biggest Redwood tree size possible is 425 ft. In terms of volume, the biggest is the Lost Monarch.
Its 40/20/40 split-fold design lets second-row passengers slide their seat to match their own idea of leg room. Page 6 No matter what youâve got planned, Sequoia is happy to oblige. Both the sliding second-row and third-row seats fold flat, making it easy to load and unload all the gear your road trip requires.
1 The Hazelwood Tree (not listed above) had a volume of 36,228 cubic feet (1,025.9 m 3) before losing half its trunk in a lightning storm in 2002, if it were still at full size it would currently be the 17th largest giant sequoia on earth.
Because most of the neighboring trees are also quite large, it can be difficult to appreciate the size of an individual giant sequoia. The largest giant sequoias are as tall as a 26-story building, and the width of their bases can exceed that of a city street. They grow at such a rate as to produce roughly 40 cubic feet (1.1 m 3) of wood each year, approximately equal to the volume of a 50-foot-tall tree one foot in diameter.
There's 19.8 cubic feet of space behind the third row seats, and the independent suspension allows that third row to fold flat into floor to free up 66.6 cubic feet. Fold the second row too, and there's a full 120.1 cubes to play with. The Sequoia's two-tone dashboard is shared with Tundra. The controls are user-friendly for the most apart, although the sheer width of the SUV can make the audio controls difficult to reach for shorter drivers.
However, with a height of 286 feet (87 m) or more, a circumference of 113 feet (34 m) or more, an estimated bole volume of up to 52,500 cubic feet (1,487 m 3), and an estimated age of 1800â2700 years, the giant sequoia is among the tallest, widest and longest-lived of all organisms on Earth.
Meet the commanding 2016 Toyota Sequoia, the SUV built to inspire your kidsâ most-liked status updates. Sequoia provides seating for up to eight, 1 along with the cargo room you want for everyoneâs gear. Inside, its host of high-tech features gives your family the ultimate in convenience and comfort.
Make no mistake: the Toyota Sequoia isn't some dainty crossover. It's a truck-based full-size SUV with ample room for eight passengers and loads of towing and hauling ability. While its one of the more refined examples of a dying breed, the Sequoia is still a thirsty rig that's a bit more cumbersome to drive than its car-derived competitors.
All Latex. This literally means the whole mattress from top to bottom and edge to edge is made of latex, whether it be 100% natural, blended or synthetic, dunlop or talalay; there could be one or more layers, but the trait is that there are no other layers (apart from the flame retardant cover).
Talalay latex is more supple and resilient. All latex is meaured in ILD (indention load deflection) and a 32 ILD in Dunlop is not firmer than a 32 ILD in Talalay, although it is stiffer. We used to carry Dunlop in Natural before we were able to get the Talalay Natural.
First, we made the worldâs most luxurious all-natural latex mattress. Then we made it affordable. You can pay $4,000 or more for a top-of-the-line latex mattress at a retail store, but it wonât match Zenhaven. Handcrafted in America of 100% natural American Talalay latex, layered with breathable 100% organic New Zealand wool and wrapped in lush organic cotton, Zenhaven takes you to new heights of comfort and health.
Talalay process latex was developed in the early 70âs and was pioneered by the new startup company Latex International. It really helped bring back latex to the forefront as a raw material used in mattresses. Essentially the Talalay process uses extreme heat and extreme cold during the vulcanization to produce very good cell structure.
Latex in general and Talalay latex in particular is very resilient, which is the exact opposite of visco elastic slow recovery foam. Visco elastic foam has been much ballyhooed as being the most pressure relieving surface foam for mattresses.
Pure Talalay Bliss uses Oeko-Tex certified Talalay Latex and fabrics in all of our mattresses. This certification verifies our products do not contain harmful substances or pose a health risk to consumers and is even safe for babies. All of our Talalay Latex is manufactured by Talalay Global in Shelton, CT, USA.
Our 100% Natual Latex is made by Radium with the Talalay process. We have found the Radium Natural Talalay to be the purest and most consistant Natural Latex. Our FloBeds Natural Latex is produced using no fillers or shortcuts. It is made from 100% Latex Rubber from the Rubber Tree. Talalay Latex provides the most supple, body conforming and long lasting mattresses.
Both Talalay Latex and Memory Foam are marketed as the premium mattress materials, but they are very different. 1  Talalay Latex is a rubber. Memory Foam is a foam, which doesn't provide both support and pressure relief. 2  Talalay Latex rubber is a natural material derived from the rubber tree.
Because dunlop is denser it is firmer and widely used as a base platform (like in the LUCID 16â³ reviewed below), whereas talalay latex is good for a more soft or plush finish so makes a great top layer (like in the DreamFoam Ultimate Dreams 10â³ reviewed below).
Even though theyâre both latex, there are significant differences between our Talalay Latex and Dunlop Latex (Latex Light). Theyâre manufactured using different processes; it takes 14 hours to make a Talalay Latex mattress core, but less than one hour to make a Dunlop mattress core.

The population of the giant panda rose 17% from 2004 to 2014. The gorilla population declined more than 70% in the past 20 years. The population of the giant panda rose 17% from 2004 to 2014. The gorilla population declined more than 70% in the past 20 years.
Red Panda Population in the Wild The current red panda population is difficult to estimate and ranges anywhere from 2,500 to 20,000. As mentioned, these red pandas are spread across several countries. China, for example, is home to just over 42% of all red panda habitats and as of 1999, has a red panda population of between 3,000 and 7,000. In India, the population is believed to be between 5,000 and 6,000.
The red panda's diet consists mainly of bamboo, although it is also known to consume insects, birds, and eggs. Conservation Status and Threats. Over the last 18 years, which accounts for 3 generations in the life of the red panda, the population size of this species has decreased by approximately 50%.
The red panda is recognized as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated population of less than 10,000 mature red pandas in the wild. The red panda is easily identifiable by its red fur and white markings.
Although the population is currently increasing, climate change is predicted to eliminate >35% of the Panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years, and thus the Panda population is projected to decline (Fan et al. 2012, Songer et al. 2012, Tuanmu et al. 2013, Li, R. et al. 2015).
The IUCN estimates that the population of giant pandas is about 1,000 to 2,000, the population of great green macaws is less than 3,700, and the population of yellow-crested cockatoos is 1,500 to 7,000.
The Qinling Mountains population is a distinctive genetic cluster and is significantly different from other mountain populations (LÃ¼ et al. 2001, Zhang, B. et al. 2007), diverging ~0.3 million years ago, corresponding with the onset of the Penultimate Glaciation (Zhao et al.
Although no formal demographic analysis is available, there are demographic data available to enable estimation of age-related population composition (Sichuan Forestry Department 2015): if the population consists of 9.6% cubs, then the total population of Pandas is approximately 2,060.
The creation of a panda reserve system in 1992 increased available habitats; today, there are 67 reserves in the country that protect 67% of the population and nearly 1.4 million hectares of habitat.
Thanks to an increase in available habitat, the population of the giant panda rose 17% from 2004 to 2014, leading the IUCN to downgrade it from endangered to vulnerable. Read More A nationwide census in 2014 found 1,864 giant pandas in the wild in China, up from 1,596 in 2004, the IUCN said in its report on the animal.
Three of those - Denzel Washington's change-of-pace ``Training Day'' psycho cop, Halle Berry's emotionally mercurial ``Monster's Ball'' widow and Will Smith's intriguingly contained portrayal of world-champion extrovert in ``Ali'' - also make up the most progressive trend in this year's race.
The first pair of psychological preferences is Extraversion and Introversion. Where do you put your attention and get your energy? Do you like to spend time in the outer world of people and things (Extraversion), or in your inner world of ideas and images (Introversion)? Extraversion and Introversion as terms used by C. G. Jung explain different attitudes people use to direct their energy. These words have a meaning in psychology that is different from the way they are used in everyday language. Everyone spends some time extraverting and some time introverting.
The typical introvert is shy, contemplative, and reserved and tends to have difficulty adjusting to social situations. Excessive daydreaming and introspection, careful balancing of considerations before reaching decisions, and withdrawal under stress are also typical of the introverted personality.
1. sociable, social, lively, outgoing, hearty, exuberant, amiable, gregarious His extrovert personality won him many friends. 1. outgoing person, mingler, socializer, mixer, life and soul of the party He was a showman, an extrovert who revelled in controversy.
With a combination of sharp observational touches and heightened soap-opera plotting, Goldbacher takes us on a magical misery tour of punk-era England as seen through the eyes of two middle-class, emotionally needy neighbors: manipulative extrovert Marina and smart, esteem-deficient Holly.
The extravert, by contrast, is characterized by outgoingness, responsiveness to other persons, activity, aggressiveness, and the ability to make quick decisions. This typology is now regarded as overly simplistic because almost no one can be accurately described as wholly introvert or extravert.
Opposite of extrovert. A person who is energized by spending time alone. Often found in their homes, libraries, quiet parks that not many people know about, or other secluded places, introverts like to think and be alone. Contrary to popular belief, not all introverts are shy.
Introvert and extravert. Introvert and extravert, basic personality types according to the theories of the 20th-century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.
A very broad term that is misunderstood, but an introvert may contain one or more of these qualities. It pretty much comes down to choice however. One who focuses on the inner world of thoughts and ideas. One who gains energy from alone time, one who thinks before they speak.
According to these theories, an introvert is a person whose interest is generally directed inward toward his own feelings and thoughts, in contrast to an extravert, whose attention is directed toward other people and the outside world.
Rhetorical Analysis of Speech a Speech by George W. Bush - In this paper I am going to discuss the rhetorical appeals, as well as the argumentative structure, audience and purpose set forth by George W. Bush in his September 27 speech in Flagstaff, Arizona.
How to Perform Rhetorical Analysis - How to Perform Rhetorical Analysis Becoming a critical reader means learning to recognize audiences, writers, points of view and purposes, and to evaluate arguments.
Rhetoric of health and medicine. The rhetoric of health and medicine is an academic discipline concerning language and symbols in health and medicine. Rhetoric most commonly refers to the persuasive element in human interactions and is often best studied in the specific situations in which it occurs. The rhetoric of health and medicine specifically creates, analyzes, and criticizes how messages are delivered and structured in medicine- and health-related contexts.
Proven Rhetorical Essay Topics You Should Use. The success of writing a proper rhetorical essay lies in choosing a good topic. While it may be difficult to decide on the particular topic, you should follow two major requirements. Firstly, focus on your interests. If the topic you want to discuss is familiar to you, you will have a head start.
The rhetoric of mental health considers how language functions in the production of knowledge on topics such as mental and psychological disorders, chemical imbalances in the brain, and variations on what are considered normal mental faculties.
Pathos is an appeal to the audienceâs emotions. The speaker may use pathos in a multitude of ways; however, in terms of the rhetoric of health and medicine, two particular emotions stand out: fear and hope.
Effectiveness of Rhetorical Devices Used in Two Articles - Critical Rhetorical Analysis In order for me to analyze the effectiveness of the rhetorical devices used in two separate articles, I read âOutsourcing: the good, the bad and the inevitableâ first to analyze then read the other article, âBan Outsourcing.
However, there are a number of topics that will always be productive. If you want to enhance your knowledge and develop your writing skills you should definitely dwell upon them. Rhetorical analysis of the speeches is highly productive.
More specifically I will refer to the rhetorical appeals of ethos, pathos and logos, and explain how they are used to gain the support and attention of the audience and further the further the purpose of the speech.
The Rhetorical in the Music of The Tempest - The Rhetorical in the Music of The Tempest In the midst of a Shakespearean play, there has and always will be a ghost that hovers over the actors and the audience. This is a ghost with a purpose, a ghost I call rhetoric.

Bronchiolitis usually starts with a runny nose and congestion. Within 2-3 days, the patient starts coughing, wheezing, and potentially breathing hard. The wheezing and tight breathing usually become worse over 2-3 days and then begin to improve. Overall, the wheeze may last up to 7 days, and the cough up to two weeks.
When to see a doctor. Talk to your doctor if wheezing is mild and is happening for the first time, it's a recurrent, unexplained problem, or it's accompanied by: 1  Difficulty breathing. 2  Rapid breathing. 3  Briefly bluish skin color.
1 Fast, labored breathing: Fluid in the smallest airways (the alveoli) causes pneumonia, an infection due to a virus or bacteria. 2  Pneumonia causes fast, labored breathing, occasionally cyanosis, a persistent cough, and crackly sounds (rales) when listened to with a stethoscope.
Bronchiolitis is a viral infection of the lungs, which affects primarily infants and toddlers. Some or all of the following symptoms are present with bronchiolitis. 1  Wheezing: a high-pitched whistling noise when your child breathes out. 2  You may actually hear this yourself, or a physician may hear wheezing when she listens to your child. 3  Rapid breathing: at a rate of 40 breaths per minute or faster.
1 Deep cough: A blockage in the large bronchi (divisions of the trachea, which lead into the lungs) makes a deep cough. 2  Whistling sound (wheezing): A blockage in the bronchioles (small airways that come from the bronchi) makes a whistling sound when the infant breathes out (as in bronchiolitis or asthma later on).
Share. Bronchiolitis is a common viral infection that affects about a third of babies in their first year (NHS 2012, Willacy 2012) . Babies are most likely to get it in the winter months, between November and March (NHS 2012, Willacy 2012) . Bronchiolitis occurs when the smallest airways of the lungs get infected, becoming swollen and filled with mucus.
Self-care measures. To ease wheezing, try these tips: 1  Moisturize the air. 2  Use a humidifier, take a steamy shower or sit in the bathroom with the door closed while running a hot shower. 3  Moist air might help relieve mild wheezing in some instances. 4  Drink fluids.
If your babyâs bronchiolitis is very severe, he could be in hospital for a while. After having bronchiolitis, some babies may be more likely to have a wheezy chest or cough, particularly while they have a cold (NHS 2011a, Willacy 2012) .
If your baby makes noises when breathing, take note of what they sound like. This will help determine if there is a problem in the breathing passages and where: 1  Whistling noise: A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. 2  Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths.

Given its name, you might assume the fruit has little nutritional valueâand it is more than 90 percent water. But a 10-ounce (300-mL) wedge of watermelon packs in about one-third of the recommended daily value of vitamins A and C, as well as a modest amount of potassium (9 percent of the daily value).
That's because watermelon is rich in an amino acid called L-citrulline, which the body converts to L-arginine, an essential amino acid that helps relax blood vessels and improve circulation.
For a long time, watermelon has been taken for granted as a sweet, tasty summertime fruit, made of sugar and water, and nothing more. Over the past years, nutritionists, medical professionals, scientists and researchers have taken an interest to find out more about watermelon's health benefits. As it turns out, watermelon is incredibly healthy! The Watermelon Board is proud to say that watermelon is the Lycopene Leader among fresh produce. In addition to its healthy properties and effects on women, children, men and pregnant women, watermelon is an important part of a healthy diet. Nutritionists have long appreciated the health benefits watermelon provides.
Watermelon seed is also rich in micro- and macro-nutrients such as magnesium, calcium, potassium, iron, phosphorous, zinc etc. Besides, the red flesh, in the Arab world, salted and roasted watermelon seeds are also consumed as a snack.

The study's seven participants, all men, were given 17 ounces (500 mL) of either natural watermelon juice, watermelon juice enriched with additional citrulline, or a placebo drink an hour before their workouts. Interestingly, the natural juice was just as effective as the enriched juice. The researchers also determined that intestinal cells can absorb more citrulline from watermelon juice than from citrulline supplements, especially when the juice is unpasteurized. 2.

Windows 10 and Intel Rapid Start Technology. I have a 2013 XPS 15 (9530) and just performed a clean Windows 10 install on it, and whilst putting everything back I realized that the Intel Rapid Start Application has not been updated since 2013 (not be confused with Intel Rapid Store Technology, also IRST, not confusing at all). So my question is .....
Intel Rapid Storage Technology is a program developed by Intel. The most used version is 9.6.0.1014, with over 53% of all installations currently using this version. Upon installation and setup, it defines an auto-start registry entry which makes this program run on each Windows boot for all user logins.
Or, you can uninstall Intel Rapid Storage Technology from your computer by using the Add/Remove Program feature in the Window's Control Panel. On the Start menu (for Windows 8, right-click the screen's bottom-left corner), click Control Panel, and then, under Programs, do one of the following:
One thing you need to know, Intel Rapid Start Technology is different from normal Sleep/Standy. IntelÂ® Rapid Start Technology transitions a system that is in Sleep or Standby, an S3 power state that keeps memory and other components powered, to a hardware power state that does not do so, an S4 power state.
So kajabla was right; the difference between sleep and the new Rapid Start Technology state is the one between S3 and S4, as you say, and it is just 0.001KW of difference; around $1 a year. From the article he linked, the data exposed: PC/Display Power: 0.008 KW avg. while in ACPI S3 Sleep.
So kajabla was right; the difference between sleep and the new Rapid Start Technology state is the one between S3 and S4, as you say, and it is just 0.001KW of difference; around $1 a year. But it's still worth it to use it, of course. We are millions of users so 1W x millions is a lot of energy.
Joe DiMaggio Should Have Been 1936 Rookie of the Year. The New York Yankees' heralded rookie, Joe DiMaggio, made his major league debut on Sunday, May 3, 1936. The greatest center fielder in New York baseball history had suffered a foot injury that delayed his season by a few weeks.
The 1938 Goudey Joe DiMaggio is considered his rookie card, and sells for about $4,000. and up in excellent+ condition. The same card graded by PSA in near/Mint-Mint conditioâ¦n could sell between $15,000. AND $40.000. A good way of finding the value of collectible items is to see what they are selling for at auction.
Joe DiMaggio joined the Yankees for the 1936 season, making his major league debut on May 3 against the St. Louis Browns. He played with a talented team which included members Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzeri, Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez. It had been two years since Babe Ruth left the Yankees, and the team was in need of a new era of success.
Joe DiMaggio Stats. Joe DiMaggio was born on Wednesday, November 25, 1914, in Martinez, California. DiMaggio was 21 years old when he broke into the big leagues on May 3, 1936, with the New York Yankees.
When did Joe DiMaggio get a bone spur? He had a bone spur in his left heel for several painful years, but  finally had an operation in the beginning of 1947. He returned for  the season, still had pain, but earneâ¦d the MVP for 1947. The pain  continued in 1948.
What position did Joe DiMaggio play?   Center Field   The first year Joe DiMaggio played he moved around the outfield, but after that he was basically the Yankees center fielder until he retired. In 1950â¦ he played one game at first base, with 13 putouts.
Joe DiMaggio. Joseph Paul Joe DiMaggio (November 25, 1914 â March 8, 1999), nicknamed Joltin' Joe and The Yankee Clipper, was an American Major League Baseball center fielder who played his entire 13-year career for the New York Yankees. He is perhaps best known for his 56-game hitting streak (May 15 â July 16, 1941), a record that still stands.
48 - Joe DiMaggio made his debut on May 3, 1936, and went three-for-six at the plate. By the end of the month (Game by Game Batting Logs), Joe had 48 hits (the most by a rookie during their first month), was batting .381, and only went hitless in two games.
July 27, 2011. The New York Yankees' heralded rookie, Joe DiMaggio, made his major league debut on Sunday, May 3, 1936. The greatest center fielder in New York baseball history had suffered a foot injury that delayed his season by a few weeks.
Bidding ended on 1/31/2016. This lot documents Joe DiMaggio's very first season in the majors. The Yankees paid the San Francisco Seals $75,000 for DiMaggio, an unbelievable price but also a huge risk as he had injured himself just the year before and many big league teams passed on his contract.

However, lead is not the only divalent (2) transition metal ion available to combine with MoO4 ions, It is trace amounts of vanadium, manganese, chromium, and titanium that depart the wonderful yellow, orange, and red colors. These elements do this by absorbing the violet, blue and green visible spectra.
As an oxidation zone mineral, wulfenite is often associated with other metals and their oxidation products. Cerussite (PbCO3), vanadinite (Pb5(VO4)3Cl), and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl) are natural associations given the presence of lead in the mineral formula.
Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm.
Molybdenum is a chemical element with symbol Mo and atomic number 42. The name is from Neo-Latin molybdaenum, from Ancient Greek Î¼ÏÎ»ÏÎ²Î´Î¿Ï molybdos, meaning lead, since its ores were confused with lead ores.
Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a free metal on Earth; it is found only in various oxidation states in minerals. The free element, a silvery metal with a gray cast, has the sixth-highest melting point of any element.
In addition to coloring elements, other impurities or factors exist that have also been linked to the color of minerals. Such things as elemental fluorine, sulfur, and chlorine; trace amounts of carbonate and other ion groups; chlorine and fluorine ions and even structural defects.
With a density of 6.5-7.0 (quartz is 2.65, calcite is 2.71), wulfenite is among the densest of all transparent minerals. However, because most of the elemental bonding in wulfenite is due to weak ionic bonds, wulfenite is soft, registering just 2.5-3.0 on the Mohs scale, or slightly softer than calcite.
Stolzite-Wulfenite Series. A secondary mineral typically found as thin tabular crystals with a bright orange-red, yellow-orange, yellow or yellowish grey colour in the oxidised zones of hydrothermal lead deposits.
They can cause a mineral to always be a certain color if they are part of the chemistry of the mineral. However, if there is just a trace of these elements, they still can strongly influence the color of the mineral. Even tiny amounts of these elements can deeply colored minerals. It is erroneously thought that certain elements cause only certain colors and there is some truth to that.

Salmond defined four modes of acquiring property. They are Possession Possession of a material object on which the title to the ownership of it exists in a person. In general, the first possessor of it will acquire a valid and good title over the object against the world. Prescription
Prescription is also a vital mode of acquiring a territory under the traditional international law. The traditional international law asserts that prescription is closely related to lawful occupation, and it entails the actual exercise of sovereignty over a territory.
Traditional international law asserts several modes of acquiring territory as cession, occupation, prescription, accretion, and conquest. Cession refers to the transfer of a territory to another state by an agreement or treaty.
Property is defined as a thing that is recognized as having some value by the society and that which is being held by a person. Salmond defined four modes of acquiring property. They are.

Accretion also abounds as another mode of acquiring a territory under the traditional international law. Notably, accretion involves the effect of natural forces such as volcanism. For instance, in cases where natural activities such as volcanism takes place and volcanic islands emerge in a stateâs territorial waters, it would have the right to acquire territory.
Another significant mode of acquiring sovereignty is effective occupation. According to the traditional international law, occupation is the effective control of a territory exercised by a power that has no sovereign title to the land through either defiance or absence of a proper sovereign.

Lapse of time could create a right or destroy a right. Hence this mode can be positive or negative. It is a combination of possession and ownership. Agreement It is a legal ownership on the property to the transferee. The agreement could be in oral or written form; Inheritance This can be of the form of testamentary succession or interstate
The last vital mode of acquisition of a territory is conquest. Conquest refers to the acquisition of a territory using force. It involves armed attacks to the territory hence bringing it under the control of a state in a forceful manner. It was historically a recognized as a legal method of acquiring sovereignty.

When did the U.S. start using paper money? On February 3, 1690, the Massachusetts Bay Colony issued the first paper money in the U.S., in order to pay for its war.

A brief history of the passport. The concept of being under one ruler's protection, while in the lands of another, has probably existed since rulers and lands were first invented, but the earliest mention of an object we might recognise as a passport appears in the Bible, in the often overlooked boo of Nehemiah.
They have replaced United States Notes, which were once issued by the Treasury Department. Federal Reserve Notes are backed by the assets of the Federal Reserve Banks, which serve as collateral under Section 16.
The authority of the Federal Reserve Banks to issue notes comes from the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Legally, they are liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks and obligations of the United States government.
By this point the term passport was being used, although whether it originated with the idea of people passing through maritime ports or through the gates in city walls (portes in French) remains a matter for debate. A passport from this period, issued on June 18 1641 and signed by Charles I, still exists. From 1794, the office of the secretary of state took control of issuing passports, a function that the Home Office retains today.

The Apennines or Apennine Mountains (/ Ë Ã¦ p Én aÉª n /; Greek: á¼ÏÎ­Î½Î½Î¹Î½Î± á½ÏÎ·; Latin: Appenninus or Apenninus Mons âa singular used in the plural; Italian: Appennini [appenËniËni]) are a mountain range consisting of parallel smaller chains extending c. 1,200 km (750 mi) along the length of peninsular Italy.
The Umbrian Apennines extend from the sources of the Tiber to (or perhaps rather beyond) the pass of Scheggia near Cagli, where the ancient Via Flaminia crosses the range. The highest point is the Monte Nerone (5010 feet).
The Abruzzi Apennines, located in Abruzzo, Molise (formerly part of Abruzzo) and southeastern Lazio, contain the highest peaks and most rugged terrain of the Apennines. They are known in history as the territory of the Italic peoples first defeated by the city of Rome.
The Apennines Mountains Map and Details print this map The source of almost all rivers in Italy including the Arno, Tiber, and Volturno, the Apennines Mountains (Ital. Appennino) 830 miles (1,350km) in length, form the backbone of the country, and run the entire length of the Italian Peninsula, ending on the island of Sicily. The highest point is Mt. Corno at 9,560 ft. (2,914 meters). They are no longer as heavily forested as in the past, as most of the slopes had been harvested over the centuries. Modern conservation and reforestation methods have really helped, and much of the new-growth is now protected by law.
This section of the Apennines is crossed by two railways, from Pistoia to Bologna and from Florence to Faenza, and by several good high roads, of which the direct road from Florence to Bologna over the Futa pass is of Roman origin; and certain places in it are favourite summer resorts.
They lend their name to the Apennine peninsula which forms the major part of Italy. The mountains are mostly green and wooded, although one side of the highest peak, Corno Grande (2,912 m), is partially covered by the southernmost glacier in Europe.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The Apennine Mountains (Greek: Î±ÏÎµÎ½Î½Î¹Î½Î¿Ï; Latin: Appenninus--in both cases used in the singular; Italian: Appennini) is a mountain range stretching 1000 km from the north to the south of Italy along its east coast, traversing the entire peninsula, and forming, as it were, the backbone of the country.
The Apennine Mountains (Greek: ÎÏÎµÎ½Î½Î¹Î½Î¿Ï; Latin: Appenninus--in both cases used in the singular; Italian: Appennini) is a mountain range stretching 1000 km from the north to the south of Italy along its east coast, traversing the entire peninsula, and forming, as it were, the backbone of the country.
Apennines (Appennino) Mountain range extending the length of Italy, a continuation of the Pennine Alps. The âbackboneâ of Italy, it stretches c.1350km (840mi) from the Genoese Riviera to the tip of the country's âtoeâ. Unselective deforestation over the years caused deep erosion and landslides.
The ancient Greeks and Romans typically but not always used mountain in the singular to mean one or a range; thus, the Apennine mountain refers to the entire chain and is translated the Apennine mountains. The ending can vary also by gender depending on the noun modified.

Your Social Security retirement benefit. 2. Your Social Security spousal benefitâwith the ability to switch to your retirement benefit at a later time. Option two is known as the restricted application for spousal benefits: You apply for Social Security but restrict. your claim to your spousal benefit. For many people, this may be an effective strategy for increasing your financial. security in retirement.
The new directive will go into effect June 1. As AOPA has previously reported, SD-8F would have required pilots based at or flying into commercial-service airports to undergo a background check and receive a security badge in order to continue to have unescorted access to their airports.
Leukocytosis, or elevated WBC count, is a commonly encountered laboratory finding. Distinguishing malignant from benign leukocytosis is a critical step in the care of a patient, which initiates a vastly different decision tree. Confirmation of the complete blood cell count and the WBC differential is the first step.
Leukocytosis is defined as an elevation of the WBC count for the patient's age. Using an appropriate reference interval is critical, because a WBC count of 30 Ã 109/L is considered elevated in an adult, but completely normal in the first few days of life.
Morphologic approach. Microcytic anemia â MCV < 80 fl. Reduced iron availability âsevere iron deficiency, the. anemia of chronic disease, copper deficiency.

The PB smear review is a qualitative examination of the blood smear to detect clinically significant abnormalities in all cells, including leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. A slide review is appropriate in all patients with unexplained leukocytosis, which requires proper slide preparation and staining.
The percentage of smudge cells in peripheral blood smears of patients with the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [26% (range, 4%-86%)] was higher than in patients with B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders [14% (range, 1%-64%)] (p=0.0005) (Figure 1). We then analyzed the discriminating capacity of the five different cut-offs.
Patients with less than 30% smudge cells had a median. time from diagnosis to initial treatment of 72.7 months, whereas. the median time from diagnosis to initial treatment in patients. with 30% or more smudge cells was not reached (P=.001). The. percentage of smudge cells as a continuous variable correlated.
Smudge cells are. CLL cells ruptured during smear preparation. We hypothesized. that smudge cell formation is inversely correlated with expression. of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein and prognostic marker, and. that the percentage of smudge cells would predict prognosis in.

We investigated whether the percentage of smudge cells in peripheral blood smears can be used in the clinical practice to differentiate CLL from other B-cell CLD. The peripheral blood smears of 63 patients with the diagnosis of CLL and 62 with other B-cell CLD were analyzed.

Ched Evans was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty of rape (PA) He made his senior debut for Wales debut in May 2008, going on to make another 12 international appearances.
Ched Evans was arrested in Rhyl in May 2011 (PA) Evans had become their star striker and was named League One Player of the Month in March 2012, shortly before he was jailed. Evans and McDonald stood trial at Caernarfon Crown Court in April 2012.
In November 2014 Goggins contributed to two online discussions about Evansâs proposed, then cancelled, return for Sheffield United, making derogatory comments and allegations about Evansâs victim. Throughout this time his picture was up on the Ched Evans website as âa True Friend and Supporter.â.
Her father has said she has been forced to change identity five times and is now living âon the runâ. The Evans website displayed a picture of Goggins, tagged âa True Friend and Supporterâ at an Amnesty International conference, wearing a T-shirt picturing a smiling Evans and the logo âChed Evans is innocentâ.
The Guardian asked those responsible for the Ched Evans website about the nature of their âtrueâ friendship with Goggins and his support. They said he was a âvocalâ supporter of Evansâs claim to have been wrongly convicted, and they only âvery recentlyâ became aware of his social media comments.
Statement on behalf of Mr. Chedwyn Evans. Ched Evans is extremely grateful that the Court of Appeal has ruled that his conviction for rape was unsafe and should be quashed.
Ched Evans is back in the news after being released from prison having served half of his sentence for rape. But who is he and what had he achieved before his conviction? Before he was jailed for rape, Evans was earning a reputed Â£20,000 a week with Sheffield United.
Sheffield United's plans to re-sign Ched Evans has been met by stiff opposition (ACTION IMAGES) McDonald, a Port Vale defender, was found not guilty of rape but Evans was convicted and jailed for five years. Sentencing, Judge Merfyn Hughes QC told him he had âthrown awayâ a successful career.
No further statement will be made as it is acknowledged by Mr Evans that the legal process has not reached a final conclusion and there will be further hearings of significance on dates to be fixed in due course.
Chedwyn Michael Ched Evans (born 28 December 1988) is a Welsh footballer who plays as a striker for League One club Chesterfield. Born in Rhyl, Denbighshire, Evans was signed by Manchester City from Chester City's youth set up in 2002 and he subsequently progressed through the ranks. Evans was loaned to Norwich City in 2007, where he scored 10 goals in 28 league appearances, before returning to his parent club. With first team opportunities at City limited he was subsequently sold to Sheffield United for Â£3 million in 2009.

Whip (politics) A whip is an official in a political party whose primary purpose is to ensure discipline in a legislature. Whips are the party's enforcers, who typically offer inducements and threaten party members to ensure that they participate according to the official party policy. A whip's role is also to ensure that the elected representatives of their party are in attendance when important votes are taken. The usage comes from the hunting term whipping in, i.e. preventing hounds from wandering away from the pack.
House of Cards Lexicon. As Netflix releases the much-anticipated second season of House of Cards, viewers brace themselves for some serious binge-watching. In the show, main character Frank Underwoodâs job title is House Majority Whip, and in the British 1990s version of House of Cards, the corresponding character is a Chief Whip.
In a legislative body, a majority whip is a member of the dominant political party whose task it is to keep voting members in line with the party's goals and ideologies. About.com expert Robert Longley explains that the majority whip ensures attendance at all important votes and legislative sessions.
Traditionally, the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of the majority party in the House, with the Majority Leader as second-in-command. For instance, when the Republicans gained the majority in the House after the 2010 elections, Eric Cantor succeeded Boehner as Majority Leader.
Before 1899, the majority party floor leader had traditionally been the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the most powerful committee in the House, as it generates the Bills of Revenue specified in the Constitution as the House's unique power.
A majority party is the political group in a legislative body with the most voting members. For example, if 47 of the 100 Senators in the U.S. Senate are Republicans and 53 are Democrats, the Democrats are the majority party.
Whatâs a Whip? As Netflix releases the much-anticipated second season of House of Cards, viewers brace themselves for some serious binge-watching. In the show, main character Frank Underwoodâs job title is House Majority Whip, and in the British 1990s version of House of Cards, the corresponding character is a Chief Whip. Do these titles have anything to do with an actual whip?
The current Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of the United States House of Representatives serves as floor leader of the opposition party, and is the counterpart to the Majority Leader. Unlike the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader is on the ballot for Speaker of the House during the convening of the Congress.
In the United States Senate, the majority whip is the third-most senior member of the ruling political party. The other party's whip is called the minority whip. Political parties also maintain rosters of subordinate whips that maintain discipline and order at lower levels of government.
In Canada the Party Whip is the member of a political party in the Canadian House of Commons, the Canadian Senate or a provincial legislature charged with ensuring party discipline among members of the caucus.
Swollen glands - what do they mean? The swollen âglandsâ that you feel â most commonly on your neck when you have a throat infection â are called lymph glands or lymph nodes. They are connected by a complicated network of tubes called lymph channels, which run all over your body.
Each adrenal gland is a two-part organ composed of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The cortex arises in the embryo from a region of the mesoderm that also gives rise to the gonads. The medulla arises from ectoderm, which also gives rise to the sympathetic nervous system.
A salivary gland infection occurs when a bacterial or viral infection affects your salivary gland or duct. The infection can result from reduced saliva flow, which can be due to a blockage or inflammation of your salivary duct. The condition is called sialadenitis.
Tumor of a gland. A disease condition of a gland (often enlargement) of a gland. Decrease of hemoglobin in the blood, caused by low red blood cell production, loss of blood, or increase of red blood cell destruction.
Which lymph nodes are swollen can help identify the problem. 1  The glands on either side of the neck, under the jaw, or behind the ears commonly swell when you have a cold or sore throat. 2  Glands in the armpit (axillary lymph nodes) may swell from an injury or infection to the arm or hand.
The endocrine glands, or ductless glands, discharge their secretions (hormones) directly into the blood; they include the adrenal, pituitary, thyroid, and parathyroid glands, the islands of Langerhans in the pancreas, the gonads, the thymus, and the pineal body.

an organ producing substances which are then secreted to the outside of the gland, sometimes by means of a duct, as in the exocrine glands, for example, the salivary mammary, lachrymal glands, but also in the case of ENDOCRINE GLANDS directly into the blood or lymphatic systems.
A salivary gland infection is typically caused by a bacterial infection. Discomfort and a foul taste in the mouth are common symptoms of a salivary gland infection. Contact your doctor immediately if you have a salivary gland infection and experience a high fever, trouble breathing or swallowing, or worsening symptoms.
We've taken it upon ourselves to rank the 32 teams most likely to win the World Cup in 2018, taking into account overall squad quality, the qualifying situation they're in and, to a lesser extent, the home-field advantage some teams might benefit from.
LUKA GONZALES/Getty Images. 1  It's the international break, so let's hit the pause button on what has been three-and-a-half frantic months of club football and turn our attention to the small matter of qualifying for the most prestigious, global event in sport: the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.
To treat superficial (minor) burns at home, follow the advice below. 1  Cool the skin with running cool or tepid water for at least 10 minutes, ideally within 20 minutes of the injury happening.  Do not use ice, iced water, creams, or greasy substances (such as butter) to soothe the burn.
Why do scars form? Scarring is related to age, ethnic origin, and the severity, depth and location of the burn. Scars form when the dermal or lower layer of the skin has been damaged, as in the case of a burn. The body forms a protein called collagen to help heal the damaged skin.
Burns can damage or destroy the oil glands that normally keep skin from getting too dry. Partial thickness burns have few oil glands and full thickness burns or skin grafts have no oil glands. The lack of oil glands leads to dry itchy scars. Many patients experience intense itching after their burn.
1 This will prevent the burn getting worse. 2  Do not use ice, iced water, creams, or greasy substances (such as butter) to soothe the burn. 3  Remove any clothes or jewellery from around the burn, unless they are sticking to it.  Cover the burn using strips of cling film, rather than wrapping it around a limb.

Hypertrophic scars: 1  Stay within the area of the original burn injury. 2  Develop within the first few months after the injury. 3  Often have a deep red to purple color and are raised above the surface of the skin.  Can be warm to the touch, hypersensitive and itchy.
If a chemical, such as bleach or acid, burns your skin, you should follow the advice below. 1  Wearing protective gloves, remove any chemicals from the skin by running the affected area under cool tap water for 20 minutes, or more.  Remove any jewellery, or clothing, that may have been exposed to the chemical.
A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors.
Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the arrival of night becomes noticeably earlier and the arrival of day becomes noticeably later, and the temperature cools down considerably.
Unusual varieties are harvested during the carrot's natural season, which is late summer and fall. True baby carrotsânot the milled down versions of regular carrots sold as baby carrots in bags at grocery storesâare available in the spring and early summer.
Very generally, an early summer bloom could mean any time from May into June; midsummer, late June into early August and late summer anywhere from the end of July to late September. Plants don't know nuthin' about calendars and it is always a bit tricky guestimating when a specific plant is likely to bloom.
In North America, autumn is usually considered to start with the September equinox (21 to 24 September) and end with the winter solstice (21 or 22 December).
Autumn (British English) or fall (American English), is one of the four temperate seasons.
Escarole is another chicory at its best in fall and winter. Fennel's natural season is from fall through early spring. Like most cool weather crops, the plant bolts and turns bitter in warmer weather. Figs have a short second season in late fall (the first harvest comes in summer) just in time for Thanksgiving.
What do early ; mid and late summer mean? I have a question about the summer months? In all the books I read about when the flower's bloom they are always saying early, mid or late summer; and I would like to know exactly which months they are. I'm pretty sure summer starts on June 21st and ends on September 21st.
You might be wondering what to expect in terms of classwork, or how youâll make new friends, or even the best place to grab a cup of coffee. Early Fall Start allows you to ease your way into life at the UW. Youâll take one course, connecting with the professor and other students in a smaller class.
Look for these fall fruits and vegetables at farmers markets and in produce departments for the best flavor (and greatest value) in season. Specific crops and harvest dates of fall produce will depend, of course, on your region's climate. See these state-specific seasonality guides for more details.
How to Get Started. Early Fall Start registration, costs and housing policies are different from the regular academic year. See the Registration & Costs page and the Housing page for more information. The University of Washington is fully committed to equal opportunity, diversity and access and inclusion.
Otis Redding co-wrote (Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay and was the first to record it in 1967 before his death in a plane crash. After it's release in 1968, it became the first posthumous number one single. Since then, many have recorded the song, including Percy Sledge and Michael Bolton.

An erosional floodplain is created as a stream cuts deeper into its channel and laterally into its banks. A stream with a steep gradient will tend to downcut faster than it causes lateral erosion, resulting in a deep, narrow channel with little or no floodplain at all.
Floodplain management is a continuous process of making decisions about whether and how floodplain lands and waters are to be used.
The purpose of this page is to define flood zones, a commonly used term in floodplain management. Definition/Description Flood hazard areas identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map are identified as a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). SFHA are defined as the area that will be inundated by the flood event having a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The 1-percent annual chance flood is also referred to as the base flood or 100-year flood.
What is Floodplain Management Floodplain management is the operation of a community program of corrective and preventative measures for reducing flood damage. These measures take a variety of forms and generally include zoning, subdivision, or building requirements, and special-purpose floodplain ordinances.
The purpose of this page is to define Zone A, a commonly used term in floodplain management.Definition/DescriptionAreas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event generally determined using approximate methodologies.
A floodplain, or flood plain, is flat or nearly flat land adjacent to a stream or river that experiences occasional flooding. It includes the floodway, which consists of the stream channel and adjacent areas that carry flood flows, and the flood fringe, which are areas covered by the flood, but which do not experience a strong current. Floodplains are formed in two ways: by erosion; and by aggradation.
Moderate flood hazard areas, labeled Zone B or Zone X (shaded) are also shown on the FIRM, and are the areas between the limits of the base flood and the 0.2-percent-annual-chance (or 500-year) flood.
For regulatory purposes, the floodplain is divided into two areas based on water velocity: the floodway & the flood fringe. The floodway includes the channel & the portion of the adjacent floodplain required to pass the 100-year flood without increasing flood heights.

For most of the area's history the land that surrounds the Clear Fork has been used as range and crop land. In 1956 the fork was dammed seven miles east of Weatherford to form Weatherford Lake. In 1949 it was dammed in Tarrant County to form Lake Benbrook, ten miles southwest of Fort Worth. Like Lake Weatherford, Lake Benbrook was constructed in part to control the seasonal flooding of the Clear Fork. CLEAR FORK OF THE TRINITY RIVER, Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rnc09), accessed October 08, 2015. Uploaded on June 12, 2010.
From the junction of the East and West Forks the Trinity River continues southeast, forming all or part of the county lines between Kaufman and Ellis, Ellis and Henderson, Henderson and Navarro, Freestone and Anderson, Anderson and Leon, Leon and Houston, and Houston and Madison counties.
The East Fork of the Trinity River rises in central Grayson County and flows south seventy-eight miles, through central Collin, western Rockwall, eastern Dallas, and western Kaufman counties, to the southwestern part of Kaufman County, where it joins the West Fork.
It flows south-southwest along the west side of the Trinity Mountains into Trinity Lake (20 miles (32 km) long) formed on the river by the Trinity Dam, then immediately into the smaller Lewiston Lake, formed by the Lewiston Dam at Lewiston.
The Elm Fork of the Trinity rises in eastern Montague County and flows southeast eighty-five miles, through Cooke and Denton counties, to a confluence with the West Fork, which forms the Trinity River proper a mile west of downtown Dallas in central Dallas County (at 32Â°48' N, 96Â°52' W).
The original Hupa name for the Trinity River was the Hoopah River. It was also known as the Indian Scalp River when first crossed by the Jedediah Smith fur-trapper's party heading northwards up the coast on May 25, 1828. The Trinity River flooded massively in the Great Flood of 1862, wiping out the economy of the area.
The Trinity River is the longest tributary of the Klamath River, approximately 165 miles (266 km) long, in northwestern California in the United States. It drains an area of the Coast Ranges, including the southern Klamath Mountains, northwest of the Sacramento Valley.
The Trinity flows 423 miles from the confluence of the Elm and West forks to the coast, making it the longest river having its entire course in Texas. The river rises on the North Central Plains, but most of its course is in the Coastal Plains area.
This 44-mile section of the Trinity River forms the boundary between Houston, Madison, Walker, and Trinity Counties and is quite similar to the previous section.
230 miles. The main stream of the Trinity River is formed by the confluence of the Elm and West Forks within the city limits of Dallas. The main stream has a sufficient flow of water at all times for recreational use.

Hence, if a continuous data falls in the range 0 to 5, the data points can take any real number value in between 0 and 5. For example, if we measure the height of the students in a class, then the data points can take any real number value within the range of height of humans.
Analysis of data obtained from discrete variables requires the use of specific statistical tests which are different from those used to assess continuous variables (such as cardiac output, blood pressure, or PaO 2) which can assume an infinite range of values.
The possible number of correct answers a student can get is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: only 6 possibilities, and this is a finite number. Therefore, if we collect data of the number of questions correctly answered by a student, then that particular data will be discrete. In a game, one has to shoot a target.
The critical value of chi-square for a significance level (or p-value) of 0.05, for example, is 3.84. The null hypothesis for the chi-square test is that there is no difference in test results between patients with and without the disease.
Using Discrete Random Variables. When given a discrete random variable, Z, you can establish the probability of each outcome with a probability function. For example, if you flip a coin and z1=heads and z2=tails, the probability function is as follows: f(z)= {1/2 for Z=z1, 1/2 for Z=z2.
In statistics, a random variable is a function of a probability space. In practical terms, a random variable is the result of an experiment. Random variables can either be discrete or continuous. When using a random variable in calculations, it is important to determine whether it is discrete or continuous, as this affects the mathematical outcomes.
by admin. Discrete vs Continuous Data. Data is the most salient entity in statistics as it is necessarily the âstudy of the collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of dataâ. The numerical data used in statistics fall in to two main categories. They are discrete data and continuous data.

A quick and easy way to check is to try putting a small magnet on the piece. If the magnet falls, your piece is solid brass and you should read on! But if the magnet sticks, your piece is brass plated steel and what youâre seeing is not tarnish but rust. Take some very fine grade steel wool and buff away the rust.
Why doesn't stainless steel rust? Stainless steel remains stainless, or does not rust, because of the interaction between its alloying elements and the environment. Stainless steel contains iron, chromium, manganese, silicon, carbon and, in many cases, significant amounts of nickel and molybdenum.
Titanium is as strong as steel, but as light as aluminum. It does not corrode, does not tarnish, and in its pure state, is totally non-allergenic. It does not react to sunlight, salt-water, or any body chemistry. It can be anodized to be a rainbow of colors. Grades 1-4 of Titanium are pure titanium. Lower grades (higher numbers) are alloys with other metals.
Does Aluminum Rust? Aluminum corrodes but it does not rust. Rust refers only to iron and steel corrosion. Aluminum is actually very prone to corrosion. However, aluminum corrosion is aluminum oxide, a very hard material that actually protects the aluminum from further corrosion. Aluminum oxide corrosion also looks a lot more like aluminum (dull gray to powdery white in color), so it isn't as easy to notice as rusted iron.
Rust is usually used to refer to a very common, reddish-brown compound called iron oxide (Fe2O3). Iron oxide is formed when iron and oxygen react in the presence of water or moisture in the air. Iron oxide is very common, because iron reacts easily with oxygen in the air. In fact, it reacts so readily with oxygen that it's actually very rare to find pure iron in nature. Rust can also refer to the reaction of iron and chloride in an underwater environment.
Though it does not rust, exposed bronze is subject to oxidation. Copper is the major component of bronze, and it passes through several stages of oxidation in the presence of oxygen and an electrolyte such as rain water.
Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen. They rust faster in salty water or acid rain. Aluminium, on the other hand, does not corrode easily, because its surface is protected by a layer of aluminium oxide. Iron is the metal most commonly associated with rust. Oxidated iron is called hydrated iron oxide, and it has the burnt orange color most commonly associated with rust.
As such, this film, otherwise known as rust, achieves sufficient thickness to make it easily observable soon after exposure to water and air. In summary, stainless steel does not rust because it is sufficiently reactive to protect itself from further attack by forming a passive corrosion product layer.
Brass is an alloy metal made up of zinc and copper. The amounts used of each are adjusted depending on the intended use of the piece. Brass is popular and is used for cookware, mirror frames, picture frames, vases, candlesticks, instruments, jewelry, fittings and so much more. Brass, like silver and other metals, does tarnish easily.
Rust occurs when iron or its alloys, such as steel, corrode. The surface of a piece of iron will begin to corrode first in the presence of oxygen and water. Given enough time, any piece of iron will change entirely into rust and disintegrate. The process of rusting is a combustion reaction, similar to fire.

Overfeeding is the number-one cause of high nitrate levels in aquariums. Overfed fish produce much more waste than normal, and when more food is given than they can take in, the uneaten food rots and produces even more wastes. Overstocking. Keeping too many fish in a tank also leads to problems with accumulated wastes.
Nitrates are less harmful to aquarium fish than nitrite but, in high doses or with prolonged exposure, they can still be dangerous. Nitrate is the third by-product of the nitrogen cycle and the ideal level in a healthy aquarium is below 30 ppm (parts per million).
Most aquarists have some familiarity with nitrite. It is part of the nitrogen cycle that takes place in most aquariums, and so is one of the first encounters that many aquarists have with their aquariums' chemistry.
Overfeeding is the number-one cause of high nitrate levels in aquariums. Overfed fish produce much more waste than normal, and when more food is given than they can take in, the uneaten food rots and produces even more wastes. Keeping too many fish in a tank also leads to problems with accumulated wastes.
The significance of nitrates in the aquarium is arguably less understood by fish keepers than the effect of ammonia and nitrites. Although nitrates are not directly lethal in the way ammonia or nitrites are, over time high levels of nitrate have a negative effect on fish, plants and the aquarium environment in general. Effect on Fish. Fish will feel the impact of nitrates by the time the levels reach 100 ppm, particularly if levels remain there.
On the other hand, if you reduce the level of water in the tank to 20% of normal and then refill the tank to a 40% level, you have already reduced your nitrate levels by... MORE half. If you then refill the tank to the 100% level, your nitrate levels will be 20% of the original level that you started out at.
During an aquarium's initial setup, few of these ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are present. As the ammonia accumulates, bacteria that utilize it increase in population. As that occurs, they consume the initial ammonia spike, and a nitrite spike results.
How to Reduce Nitratesâ. 1  Keep the tank clean â Waste ultimately produces nitrates. Cleaner tanks produce fewer nitrates in the first place. 2  Donât overfeed the fish â Overfeeding is a significant contributor to excess nitrates and other undesirable wastes, such as phosphates.
Although nitrates are not directly lethal in the way ammonia or nitrites are, over time high levels of nitrate have a negative effect on fish, plants and the aquarium in general. Although nitrates are not directly lethal in the way ammonia or nitrites are, over time high levels of nitrate have a negative effect on fish, plants and the aquarium in general.
Lower the nitrite level. 1  You can dilute the nitrite level with a 25% partial water change. If your tank is new, try to leave the biological filter and gravel bed alone so the bacteria are not disturbed and will keep multiplying. 2  Filter out the nitrite directly using API Nitra Zorb filter media in freshwater aquariums.

With an FSA, your employer withholds up to $5,000 per year at your request from your paycheck pre-tax, and you supply receipts to the plan administrator to be reimbursed for your preschool expenses that would qualify for the child and dependent care credit.o claim the child and dependent care credit, you must have earned income for the year you're filing for. If you're married, your spouse must also have earned income. The credit enables you and your spouse to both work, earn income and pay additional taxes.
1 CHILD CARE: If you send your child to daycare or hire a babysitter in order to go to work or school, you can claim child care expenses. 2  The deduction limit is $7,000 for each child under the age of seven and $4,000 for children seven to 16 years of age. So if your monthly pass costs $100, you can claim $1,200, which would result in a tax credit of $180 ($100 x 12 months x 15 percent). 2  You can claim these costs for any dependent children under 19. 3  Be sure to keep your passes so you can substantiate the amount you spent.
Your child can claim a federal and provincial tax credit for the tuition amount. To claim the tax credit, she must file her income taxes and complete federal Schedule 11 and the provincial schedule.f your child is a student and qualifies for the tuition amount, it's a good idea to make sure she prepares her income tax return first. She should receive the T2202A tax slip from her college or university.
But it continues to be traded around the world long after New Yorkâs close, unlike securities. E ach day of forex trading starts with the opening of the Australasia area, followed by Europe and then North America.
Posted: 11/03/2014 8:55 pm EST Updated: 11/03/2014 11:59 pm EST. Tuesday is Election Day in America, so here's a roundup of when the polls close in each state. If you still haven't figured out where you have to go to cast your vote, use this tool to find your polling place.
How it works. The Best-time Close works by emphasising how now is the best time to buy and how delaying is not the best thing to do.
Since most participants trade between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. in their local time zone, these times are used as the market open and close times, respectively.
The forex market is available for trading 24 hours a day, five and one-half days per week. The Forex Market Time Converter displays Open or Closed in the Status column to indicate the current state of each global Market Center.
Forex Market Trading Hours. T he ability of the Forex to trade over a 24-hour period is due in part to different time zones and the fact it is comprised of a network of computers, rather than any one physical exchange that closes at a particular time.
Colorado and Washington voters are participating in a mail-in election, but voters are able to submit their ballots at designated drop off locations on Election Day. NOTE: All times are listed in Eastern Time. States designated by * have multiple closing times, as they span more than one time zone.
I f you need to know the exact times that the markets open and close, you have to take time zones into consideration. It is very simple when expressed in GMT. This is Greenwich Mean Time. This is the standard (winter) time in Greenwich, London which is the point of zero longitude on the globe. The normal Forex market hours are 22.00 Sunday GMT to 22.00 Friday GMT.
Technique. When people are procrastinating or will 'be back', emphasise how now is the best time to buy. All sales people know that 'there are no bebacks'. Invoke seasonal effects, such a Summer, Christmas and other holidays. Remind them of other short-term reasons, including sales, weather, and so on.
As one regionâs markets close another opens, or has already opened, and continues to trade in the forex market. Often these markets will overlap for a couple hours providing some of the most active forex trading.

Letâs say you have $300,000 in retirement savings and plan to withdraw 4 percent ($12,000) annually for 30 years. If your portfolio declines by 10 percent in the first year of your retirement, itâs already sunk to $258,000 at the end of year one, including your first year of withdrawals.
If you earn 6 percent a year annually on a $300,000 retirement nest egg and withdraw 4 percent a year, youâd be left with $506,331 at the end of 30 years. Now, assume a 12 percent return in year one and 0 percent in year two, in a repeating pattern for 30 years.
About 34 percent of current workers expect Social Security to largely fund their retirement, the highest Gallup has recorded in this decade-long annual survey, and up 7 percentage points since 2007. [Use the U.S. News Mutual Fund Score to find the best investments for you.]. Retirement accounts.
To figure out how much you will save by the time you retire, we first estimate your future income by growing your current income at a rate of 3.8% (the inflation rate of 2.3%, plus the salary growth rate of 1.5%). Then, we determine what the sum of your annual contributions will be between now and retirement.
In fact, 35 percent of workers between the ages of 45 to 54 have less than $25,000 in retirement savings. And more than six out of 10 have less than $100,000. At the same time, they are paying for big-ticket nonretirement expenses, such as college tuition, which can throw a wrench into growing a considerable nest egg.
The second point in time is the day you retire, when you are about 65 to 66 years old. That period between now and then is an important one. In those (approximately 10 to 15) years, you will have time to put more of your paycheck to work in a retirement account.
So if you earn $100,000 the year you retire, we estimate you will need $85,000 during the first year of retirement. For each subsequent year, we increase your income need by 2.3% to keep up with inflation.
If your portfolio declines by 10 percent in the first year of your retirement, itâs already sunk to $258,000 at the end of year one, including your first year of withdrawals.
4. You can expect to get an average of 7 to 8 percent per year from a diversified domestic stock portfolio. When youâre setting goals for retirement savings, many online calculators will ask what you expect to make on your portfolio.
How we calculate your savings goal. First, we determine what your income will be at the time you retire by growing your current income at an annual rate of 3.8% (the inflation rate of 2.3%, plus the salary growth rate of 1.5%). We then assume you can live comfortably off of 85% of your pre-retirement income.

By Matt Rosenberg. Near the equator, from about 5Â° north and 5Â° south, the northeast trade winds and southeast trade winds converge in a low pressure zone known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone or ITCZ. Solar heating in the region forces air to rise through convection which results in a plethora of precipitation.he location of the ITCZ can vary as much as 40Â° to 45Â° of latitude north or south of the equator based on the pattern of land and ocean. In Africa, the ITCZ is located just south of the Sahel at about 10Â°, dumping rain on the region to the south of the desert.
The Intertropical Convergence Zone has been called the doldrums by sailors due to the lack of horizontal air movement (the air simply rises with convection). The ITCZ is also known as the Equatorial Convergence Zone or Intertropical Front.he location of the ITCZ can vary as much as 40Â° to 45Â° of latitude north or south of the equator based on the pattern of land and ocean. In Africa, the ITCZ is located just south of the Sahel at about 10Â°, dumping rain on the region to the south of the desert.
In the seamen's speech the zone is referred to as the doldrums because of its erratic weather patterns with stagnant calms and violent thunderstorms. The ITCZ appears as a band of clouds, usually thunderstorms, that circle the globe near the equator.In the Northern Hemisphere, the trade winds move in a southwestern direction from the northeast, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they move northwestward from the southeast.s the ITCZ migrates more than 500 kilometres (300 mi) from the equator during the respective hemisphere's summer season, increasing Coriolis force makes the formation of tropical cyclones within this zone more possible.
The Tropical Climate Control. The most important climate control in regard to the tropical climate types relates to the position of the Inter Tropical Convergent Zone or ITCZ. The ITCZ is an area of low pressure and marks the point of trade wind convergence.he second distinctive climate feature of tropical regions is the dry season. As you can see from the diagram to the right of the Hadley circulation air rises above the ITCZ to create a low pressure zone, characterised by high humidity and rainfall. Further north and south of this zone air begins to sink.
Definition. The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, is a belt of low pressure which circles the Earth generally near the equator where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together. It is characterised by convective activity which generates often vigorous thunderstorms over large areas.efinition.

ITCZ) or equatorial trough. This line of convergence near the equator is also discernible in a map of streamlines (Figure 12.2; Note 12.A). It is actually a band a few hundred kilometres wide, enclosing places where winds flow inwards (are 'confluent') and subsequently rise convectively.he movement of the ITCZ across South Africa (Figure 12.1) is complicated by the land's shape, elevation and location, and there is a southerly spur called the Zaire Air Boundary (ZAB). Similarly, there is a spur over South America.

While I doubt Hemmingway (if he indeed said it) meant it to be literal, there is something to the idea of the Balmer Peak. I think the quotation is a different way of saying something that most people who write have heard before: the first draft should be as un-self-critical as you can manage. Create now, worry later.

Dogs can eat black beans! Black beans can be added to a personâs diet but what about for dogs? Beans are generally safe for your dogs and this includes black beans, green beans and even white beans. Black beans are known to have a high amount of protein which is needed by most dogs.
Can Dogs Eat Beans â The Benefits. Beans contain large amounts of protein that are a necessary part of your dogâs diet. They also contain other nutrients like magnesium, potassium, fiber, folate, iron, phytonutrients and B vitamins. These nutrients increase your dogâs immunity and burn fat.
These are just a few of the human foods that you can toss your dogâs way. Remember to try them in small amounts. If your dog experiences any sort of reaction, immediately consult a veterinarian. Before giving your dog any people food, do your research to make sure itâs safe. Never feed your dog toxic human items such as: chocolate, onions, grapes, raisins, yeast dough, artificial sweeteners, macadamia nuts, avocadoes, alcohol, or coffee. Consult your veterinarian with any questions on what is safe and what is harmful.
Dog approved people food. We try to keep our dogs on their canine diets but sometimes we just canât resist slipping them an occasional human morsel. If youâd like to reward your pet with a table scrap, make sure that you choose people foods that are safe for canine tummies. 1. Peanut butter.
Feeding your dog with black beans can also cause some oral problems in your dog. It is recommended that oral hygiene should be maintained if black beans are part of your dogâs diet. Post by: Adrian Sau. Beans, Black, Black Beans, can dogs eat, dogs eat, Food, what can dogs eat. Can Dogs Eat Garlic Can Dogs Eat Fruit.
Can be slipped into the bowl along with your dogâs regular food to add a spice and extra protein to its diet. This also makes a good meal replacement if youâre in a pinch and out of dog food. 3. Cheese. A great treat for a dog as long as she isnât lactose intolerant, which a small percentage are.
However, the green beans are best for your dogs. These have proteins, nutrients and minerals that are of good use to your dog. Raw green string beans are suitable for a healthy snack. Most dogs will eat green beans, preferably raw. They are a good low calorie food for the dog and as long as they donât cause intestinal upset, they are fine for the dog to eat. Lentils are very good for dogs, are very alkaline and do not cause gas.
Why are beans safe for my dog? Dogs eat a wide range of foods, which is why many dog owners are asking about the foods that their dogs can eat. Just like human beings, dogs need to have a balanced diet and this they can get by taking a variety of foods.
Always be careful when feeding your dog human food. Sometimes there can be quite a bit of spices in baked beans as well as sugar. It would be better to give them just plain black beans, kidney beans, pinto beans, etc. with no salt or pepper, no spices of any kind â just rinsed off, right out of the can.
While extremely nutritious and good for your dogâs health, beans have a tendency of develop gas. This may not hold any serious danger at first, but chronic gas can eventually lead to constipation. 1  Wash beans thoroughly.  Feed your dog moderate amounts of any food not part its natural diet.
So of the 118 cruise ships delivered since 2000 sixty-seven, or more than half, are too big to transit the Panama Canal. The next category down is Panamax, which is the maximum size ship that can use the Panama Canal (although new locks are due to open in 2015).
An Upgrade, And Bigger Ships, For The Panama Canal. An Upgrade, And Bigger Ships, For The Panama Canal. The Panama Canal is undergoing its biggest overhaul since it was opened nearly a century ago. A third channel is being built, which will allow more and larger ships to pass through. The Panama Canal is undergoing its biggest overhaul since it was opened nearly a century ago.
We have nine ships that can fit, but we choose not to offer Panama Canal cruises. We have no desire for it.. CORRECTION: A story in Travel Weekly's July 25 print edition incorrectly said that the canal expansion would accommodate all current cruise ships, rendering the term post-Panamax obsolete.
118 New Ships Since 2000 - Ship Sizes - The New Panama Canal. The recent announcement by CLIA that 118 new cruise ships had been delivered since 2000 has led The Cruise Examiner to have a look at how the world cruise fleet is now made up and how it has changed in the last decade. The findings, along with progress now being made on a new Panama Canal, are rather interesting.
Most cruise ships transiting the Panama Canal will continue to use the old locks. Cruise lines have several ships operating in Alaska that would need the new locks to move to the Atlantic, such as Royal Caribbean Internationalâs Explorer of the Seas and Celebrity Cruisesâ Celebrity Solstice.
Only one cruise ship has reserved space to move through the new locks, which are open to one cruise ship a day starting in June 2017, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Princess Cruises' Caribbean Princess is scheduled to make a series of thirteen 10-day cruises through the canal beginning Oct. 21, 2017.
Just one cruise ship scheduled to use new Panama Canal locks. The new, wider locks on the Panama Canal will open June 26 with the first official transit of a cargo ship, but donât expect much traffic through them from cruise ships.
As cruise ships carry passengers and not heavy cargoes, this is not a problem for them, as even the Queen Mary 2 has only a draft of 32 feet 10 inches, which means that there is really no such thing as a Suezmax cruise ship.
The eleven ships of the Carnival Conquest (six) and Costa Concordia (five) classes, all 952 by 116 feet in overall dimensions, are ten feet too wide for the present Panama Canal. Eleven more ships, of the Grand Princess class, including P&O's Azura and Ventura, all 951 x 118 feet, also fall into this category.
Usually when people think of the expansion of the canal they think about the bigger ships, says Arnold Cano, an engineer who's working on the project. Right now they can't fit through the Panama Canal. And that's a big aspect of the expansion. But really, the main driver for the expansion is capacity, being able to transit more cargo.. By adding a third lane, 50 percent more ships will be able to pass through the waterway each day.
Certain types of businesses and clients choose to safeguard their companies against similar, competing businesses. Companies that require signed contracts with non-compete provisions do so to prevent employees or independent contractors from providing their services to competing businesses.
The Department of Labor will weigh the following factors when classifying a worker as an employee or as an independent contractor under the Economic Reality Test. 1  How much, if any, of an investment the worker has in the facilities or work equipment;  The type or level of control a company has over the worker;
As an employee or independent contractor with certain clients or businesses, it is to your advantage to obtain a written contract or agreement that clearly defines the terms of the job or project. In addition, watch for non-disclosure clauses or provisions.
Persons who work as real âindependent contractorsâ are not entitled to the same monetary benefits and legal protections as âemployees.â This is because independent contractors are not subject to the same types of restrictions, level of discipline, and fixed work schedules as are employees.
Also known as the âMaster-Servantâ or âCommon Law Agencyâ test, the âRight to Controlâ test is often applied by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to differentiate employees form independent contractors. The key issue in the Right to Control test is the amount of control an employer exercises over the worker.
Maybe you've never thought about the difference between being an employee and being an independent contractor (also called a consultant). In many respects, there seems to be no difference at all. Often, independent contractors and employees work side by side at the same company, even doing the same or similar work. But there are very important legal differences between being a contractor and an employee. These differences go beyond job title.
Many persons are misclassified as âindependent contractorsâ but are actually âemployeesâ under federal, state and Illinois law for purposes of the overtime pay laws. Under the FLSA, true independent contractors are not employees and are not eligible for overtime compensation.
The courts primarily use two tests to determine whether an individual qualifies as an employee or as an independent contractor: the âright to control testâ and the âeconomic reality test.â They are both described below.
As an employee or independent contractor, you may have to sign a contract that contains a non-compete provision. The main purpose of the clause is to safeguard proprietary information from similar, competing companies.
Typically, when you sign a contract with non-compete provisions, you must agree to some or all of the following points: 1  You will not provide similar skills or services to a competing business.  You will not provide similar skills or services within a specified geographical area.

By the 1980s and early 1990s, 10 to 20 per cent of Ghanaians were living outside Ghana, with many migrating to Australia, Canada, Netherlands, United States and the UK from the 1960s to 1980s due to economic conditions at those times in Ghana.

By the 1980s, the UK was experiencing a boom in African music as Ghanaians and others moved there, immediately they made their presence felt in the form of local gigs and carnivals, and to this day Ghanaians and other African groups prevail as the most successful ethnic groups in the UK R&B and rap scene.
Although modern Ghana gained independence in 1957 and was the first African country to do so from the European Colonization. People from that region have been arriving and living in Britain since at least the midâ16th century.

Naval Construction Battalions were conceived of as a replacement for civilian construction companies working for the US Navy after the United States was drawn into World War II with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.
TENNO REINFORCEMENTS. Posted On 2014-03-26 18:00:15. Warframe is celebrating its One Year Anniversary! DEX FURIS - In celebration of Warframe's First Year, and to Thank all who have helped build Warframe into what it is today, The Lotus is gifting each Tenno with a First Anniversary Edition of the DEX FURIS. This dual version features a Lotus-themed skin, high fire rate and accuracy and low recoil.
The battalion is the fundamental unit of the Naval Construction Force (NCF). Seabee battalions are constituted in such a way as to be self-sustaining in the field. The nomenclature for NCF battalions has evolved over the years.
When the US entered World War I in April 1917, the Navy had an immediate requirement to expand the Great Lakes Station in order to house, process, and train 20,000 naval recruits, this number would rise to 50,000 by the end of the year.
Bugs Bunny. Bugs Bunny is an animated cartoon character; created in 1940 by Leon Schlesinger Productions (later Warner Bros. Cartoons) and voiced originally by the legendary vocal artist, Mel Blanc.
National Guard. We recognize December 13th as the birthday of the National Guard. On this date in 1636, the first militia regiments in North America were organized in Massachusetts. Based upon an order of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's General Court, the colony's militia was organized into three permanent regiments to better defend the colony.
Bugs' first appearance in A Wild Hare (1940). While Porky's Hare Hunt was the first Warner Bros. cartoon to feature a Bugs Bunny-like rabbit, A Wild Hare, directed by Tex Avery and released on July 27, 1940, is widely considered to be the first official Bugs Bunny cartoon.
Our ability to recognize December 13, 1636, as the organization date of the oldest Army National Guard units is based in law. The Militia Act of May 8, 1792, permitted militia units organized before the May 8, 1792, to retain their customary privileges..
Tenno, in three years you have succeeded in 1.5 billion Missions, killed over 50 billion Grineer, captured 120 million prisoners and significantly grown to over 12 million Operators. Thank you to everyone who has accompanied us on this journey, and thank you to the Tenno who continue to fight this war with us! ANNIVERSARY GIFTS.
Though a similar rabbit character began appearing in the Warner Bros. cartoon shorts during the late 1930s, the definitive character of Bugs Bunny is widely credited to have made his debut in director Tex Avery's Oscar-nominated film A Wild Hare (1940).
Like all of the planets, the massive gas giant Saturn travels in an ellipse rather than a circular path, and so its distance from the sun varies slightly over the course of its year. Saturn averages 886 million miles (1.4 billion km) from the sun, nine and a half times Earth's average distance.At its farthest (aphelion), Saturn hovers 934 million miles (1.5 billion km) from the sun; at its closest (perihelion), the distance to Saturn from the sun is only 839 million miles (1.4 billion km).he most distant of the planets obviously visible to the naked eye, Saturn is the sixth planet in the solar system. Because it travels in an elliptical path rather than a circular one, it doesn't always lie the same distance from the sun as it wanders through the sky.
Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.Although only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive.aturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique. The rings extend from 6,630 km to 120,700 km above Saturn's equator, average approximately 20 meters in thickness and are composed of 93% water ice with traces of tholin impurities and 7% amorphous carbon.

And no waltz with Viennese cooking would be complete without Wiener Schnitzel, beaten flat, breaded and crisply fried, this is something of a national dish, It was so fresh and uncomplicated I wanted to break into a chorus of Edelweiss, but of course I had my mouth full of Schnitzel.
The word Schnitzel is believed to come from the word der Schnitz which means a slice or a cut, similarly Schneider means a tailor. (Because he is a cutter, of fabric) A popular bread that uses the word base is Schnitzbrot. Usually it is slices of apple or pear and other dried fruits and nuts for the Christmas season.
Meat: Classically you have to take veal (Wiener Schnitzel), but most people prefer pork (Schnitzel Wiener Style). Best meat imho are at least 1 inch thick slices of the Nuss. If you don't know what this is, go at google.de, search for schwein nuss and take a look at the first two results.
The most well known Schnitzel is Wienerschnitzel which is traditionally Veal, breaded with crumbs and served with lemon and German potato salad or parsley potatoes and sometimes Lingonberry Jam.
What exactly is Schnitzel? Schnitzel is a meat dish that is a very thin boneless cutlet of veal, pork, beef or chicken that is either breaded and deep fried or pan fried with or without a breading.

The visit to Wounded Knee is a pilgrimage to remembrance, to there where we are driven to be mindful of and reflect upon the sad choices that we humans sometimes make, and worse, the persistent, continued widespread endorsement that those choices receive... Wounded Knee is well-marked on the map and easy to get to.
I am planning a visit to Wounded Knee this summer with my two granddaughters (11,10). I am a 74 year old woman traveling alone with them. Is it a safe place to take them. I have longed to visit the place and have great sympathy for what our government did to the native americans.
My husband and I traveled to the Wounded Knee Monument on our Western Tour '16. It was difficult I find, but I was looking forward to arriving and stepping into a museum that would give me information about the history, characters, and other facts about the terrible massacre that occurred there.
The previous day, a detachment of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment commanded by Major Samuel M. Whitside intercepted Spotted Elk's band of Miniconjou Lakota and 38 Hunkpapa Lakota near Porcupine Butte and escorted them 5 miles (8.0 km) westward to Wounded Knee Creek, where they made camp.
A brutal massacre followed, in which itâs estimated 150 Indians were killed (some historians put this number at twice as high), nearly half of them women and children. The cavalry lost 25 men. The conflict at Wounded Knee was originally referred to as a battle, but in reality it was a tragic and avoidable massacre.
So happy to finally make the trip to pay my respect to those killed and Wounded Knee Creek on 12/29/1890 and burred here in a mass grave in this active cemetery. Also paid respect to some killed at this site in 1973 in a stand off with the Federal Government, the American Indian Movement and tribal leaders.
Wounded Knee Massacre. Not to be confused with Wounded Knee incident. The Wounded Knee Massacre occurred on December 29, 1890, near Wounded Knee Creek (Lakota: ÄhaÅkpÃ© Ãpi WakpÃ¡la) on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the U.S. state of South Dakota.
More than 80 years after the massacre, beginning on February 27, 1973, Wounded Knee was the site of the Wounded Knee incident, a 71-day standoff between militants of the American Indian Movementâwho had chosen the site for its symbolic valueâand federal law enforcement officials.
Wounded Knee, located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwestern South Dakota,was the site of two conflicts between North American Indians and representatives of the U.S. government. An 1890 massacre left some 15 0Native Americans dead, in what was the final clash between federal troops and the Sioux. In 1973, members of the American Indian Movement occupied Wounded Knee for 71 days to protest conditions on the reservation. Play video.
Wounded Knee is a place for education, rememberance, and respect. It's a fantastic visit and trip to make if you wish to understand the incident and respect the traditions and values of 19th century Native Americans.
âInterested party for the purpose of filing a protestâ means an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.
533.103 Protests to the agency. 533.103-1 Filing a protest. (a) Any protester filing an agency protest has the choice of requesting either that the contracting officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest is silent on this matter, the contracting officer will decide the protest.
To file a bid protest, a protestor must demonstrate that it has standing as an interested party, meaning the protestor must be an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.
This part prescribes policies and procedures for filing protests and for processing contract disputes and appeals. There are other Federal court-related protest authorities and dispute-appeal authorities that are not covered by this part of the FAR, e.g., 28 U.S.C. 1491 for Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction.
An agency protest is filed when the complete protest is received at the location the solicitation designates for serving protests. GSAâs hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Protests delivered after 4:30 p.m. will be considered received and filed the following business day.
Contrary to a common misconception, a protest is not always timely if filed within 10 days of a debriefing. As one prospective protester learned, if the debriefing is not ârequiredâ under applicable law, a GAO protest filed within 10 days of a debriefing might be untimely. GAO regulations set specific (and strict) protest filing deadlines. Protests relating to improprieties in the solicitation itself, for example, must be filed before the bid opens or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. 4 C.F.R. Â§ 21.2(a)(1).
(f) No person may file a protest at GAO for a procurement integrity violation unless that person reported to the contracting officer the information constituting evidence of the violation within 14 days after the person first discovered the possible violation (41 U.S.C. 2106).
533.103-1 Filing a protest. ( 1 a) Any protester filing an agency protest has the choice of requesting either that the contracting officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. ( 2 b) If an agency protest is filed, the deciding official uses the procedures in FAR 33.103 and this section to resolve the protest.
A contractor challenging a federal procurement may generally choose to file a bid protest before the agency administering the procurement, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (COFC).
To obtain a CICA stay, the protestor only needs to file its protest within 10 days of the contract award or within five days of its debriefing. However, the requirement for a CICA stay is not triggered until GAO provides notice of the protest filing to the contracting agency.

Updated March 03, 2017. Below you will find a list of the largest islands in the world based on size or area followed by a list of the largest islands in the world based on population. 1. Greenland - North America - 840,004 square miles - 2,175,600 sq km. 2. New Guinea - Oceania - 312,167 square miles - 808,510 sq km.
21 of the 29 islands on the following chart are in Alaska, and 3 more are in Hawaii. Technically, Alaska actually is continental, but even if the more correct term contiguous United States is used to describe the lower 48, Whidbey Island still ranks only 5th in length.
THE largest island in the world is Greenland. Probably. You have to disqualify all the bigger landmasses as continents, and ignore the possibility that Greenland might actually be three smaller islands connected by an ice sheet.
Greenland is considered the world's largest island and it is situated in the Arctic Ocean to the north east of Canada.
The Caspian Sea is the largest lake in the world.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------   The area of Caspian Sea is 3 626 000 kmâ¦2.   Around the Caspian Sea are the following countries: Russia,  Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan.
One superlative remains: Whidbey Island is indeed the longest island on the Pacific coast of the contiguous United States. This is mainly due to lack of competition from the almost island-free coasts of California and Oregon, though.
Whidbey Island in Washington state is always calling itself the longest island in the United States, or the longest island in the continental United States, or, sometimes, the longest saltwater-surrounded island in the continental United States.
Super Vegito overwhelms Buu with power, beating the monster to a pulp. Eventually beginning to toy with Buu, Buu uses his magic to transform Vegito into a piece of candy. Despite his form, Vegito retains all of his physical strength and control, beating Buu down further with intense speed.
. - Vegetto, asking Vegeta and Goku how they defeated Buu. For information regarding Vegetto as he appears in Dragon Ball Z, go to Dragon Ball Wiki. Vegetto (spelt Vegito in some English translations) is the fusion of Goku and Vegeta through the use of the Potala Earrings. In Universe 16, Vegetto never unfused after entering Buu's body, and went on to father Gohan, Goten, Trunks and Bra.
It isn't until Vegito appears inside Buu that it is revealed that it was all a plan by Vegito to rescue Piccolo, Goten, Trunks, and Gohan. Thanks to a barrier formed by Vegito, he is not absorbed into a pod like the others. Once the barrier is let down, Vegito defuses back into Goku and Vegeta.
Despite his pride, Vegeta, to save his only son, agrees to the fusion. Together, Goku and Vegeta fuse to become the fighter Vegito. Vegito is incredibly powerful upon his original appearance, beating Buu easily. Once Buu decides to use his absolute power, Vegito turns into a Super Saiyan. Super Vegito is statistically the most powerful character in the Dragon Ball Z storyline.
Vegito is able to transform into a Super Saiyan, calling himself  Super Vegito  (or Super Vegerot in the English manga) in this form. As a Super Saiyan, he gains a slight increase in muscle mass, bluish-green eyes, very defined golden hair and eyebrows and a golden aura (with occasional surges of blue electricity).
Vegito is born. Vegito before transforming into a Super Saiyan. Vegito is a fusion formed out of desperation by Goku and Vegeta in an effort to stop Super Buu, an ancient and powerful being whose only purpose is to destroy.
â . The Incredible Fighting Candy . Vegito cannot transform into this form willingly, he takes the form of a coffee-flavored jawbreaker after being turned into it by Super Buu. Super Buu turns Vegito so that he can consume him, but Vegito is still able to fight as a small candy.
Character Â» appears in 31 games. Goku and Vegeta fuse using the Potara Earrings to become Vegito, the most powerful character in the entire Dragon Ball Z storyline. With the strengths of the two greatest Saiyans, Vegito knows no equal in DBZ.
Vegito's personality is a mixture of both Goku and Vegeta's characteristics. He exhibits Vegeta's cockiness and inclination for taunting others, and playing around with his enemies, wanting them to suffer, but is not as serious, having inherited Goku's easygoing, cheerful nature, easily toying with his opponents.
The Potara Earring Fusion used to form Vegito is what Old Kai considers to be the proper way to do fusion, as opposed to the Fusion Dance technique. The resulting fusion lasts forever, even if the fused being removes the earrings.
Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the Borrelia type. The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness, known as erythema migrans, that begins at the site of a tick bite about a week after it has occurred.
Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks of the Ixodes genus. Usually, the tick must be attached for 36 to 48 hours before the bacteria can spread. In North America, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia mayonii are the cause.
Lyme Disease has many symptoms including fever, sweats, chills, flushing, weight changes, fatigue and tiredness, swollen glands, sore throat, pelvic pain, urinary problems, loss of libido, upset stomach, stiffness in the joints, back and neck, muscle pain, cramps, twitching, headaches, tingling, numbness, burning and stabbing sensations, facial ...
Lyme disease causes depression, which can cause mood swings. Additionally, the pain associated with Lyme is enough to cause patients to become irritable. Lyme disease is a systemic infection that can affect all systems of the human body. This disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by the spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi.

// Filed in: Lyme Disease Symptoms. Depression. It isn't all in your head. Some of the symptoms related to the brain and nervous systems that have been observed in Lyme patients are headache, tremor, facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), tremor, burning or sharp stabbing sensations, numbness, irritability, dementia, and mood swings.
If you are unusually depressed, or your mood swings are worsening, and you also have some of the other symptoms associated with the disease, such as crushing fatigue, fever, rash, or arthritis, it is very important to consult a Lyme-literate doctor with experience in recognizing Lyme symptoms.
Not all patients with Lyme disease have all symptoms, and many of the symptoms are not specific to Lyme disease, but can occur with other diseases, as well. The incubation period from infection to the onset of symptoms is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days), or much longer (months to years).
Damien Darhk's description from Ra's doesn't equate to his comic counterpart- but it's possible the writers have amalgamated two characters. Doctor Ebeneezer Darrk was assigned by Ra's to head the League of Assassins, who accordingly holds his own mini league of followers.
Damian Wayne. Damian Wayne or Damian al Ghul (Arabic: Ø¯Ø§ÙÙØ§Ù Ø§ÙØºÙÙ) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Batman. He is the son of Batman and Talia al Ghul (Arabic: ØªØ§ÙÙØ§ Ø§ÙØºÙÙ), and thus the grandson of Batman villain Ra's al Ghul.
Damian is flustered by Superman's sudden appearance, and Superman asks if Batman is in. When Nightwing confirms he is at his computer, Damian interjects that his father has been, Broodier then usual.. Superman merely responds that his father is the master of brooding.
Damian Wayne is a fictional character in the DC Universe. Damian is the child of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul and thus the grandson of Batman's villain, Ra's al Ghul. The character was created by Mike W. Barr, and first appeared in Batman: Son of the Demon (1987).
This version of Damian Wayne is in a future where Damian becomes Batman after he is unable to save the second Batman from being killed by an unknown killer. Damian has some supernatural power, is willing to kill, as well as having a cat he has named Alfred. Robin: Judge, Jury, Executioner.
Ra's al Ghul's description matches neither character perfectly, but together it does. Ra's says that Damien has a hive of followers - it would seem, in this universe, Darhk heads HIVE, who are his own loyalists who departed the League of Assassins alongside him.
Damian Wayne as Nightwing is a playable character, as the Regime Costume for Nightwing in Injustice: Gods Among Us. He is classified as a Gadget user. He is an agile fighter, and can combine his dual sticks into a large staff.
Batman and Son. Batman and Son is a 2006 comic book story arc featuring the DC Comics character Batman. Written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Andy Kubert, the story was published in four parts in the comic book Batman starting in #655 and ending in #658.
Many speculated that this could mean Damien Wayne, son of the Dark Knight, who has connections to Ra's, but that seemed unlikely (edit: ironically, it's come to my attention the Facebook page for Moviepilot actually shared this as Damien Wayne. That's an error such as the one above).

Roy flies into a violent rage and Pam ends the relationship on the spot. The next day, Roy attempts to attack Jim in the office but is stopped by Dwight's pepper spray and is fired. After losing his job, Roy meets Pam for coffee and says that even though Jim is dating Karen, she should at least make an effort to date him, as she called off the wedding because of him.
The Office brought the workplace comedy to new heights and provided a platform to showcase the talents of individuals who have gone on to become some of the biggest names in Hollywood. Ahead, find out where they are now.
Krasinski broke out as the deadpan, lovelorn, prank-loving Jim Halpert, earning legions of fans for his quiet yearning for office receptionist Pam (Jenna Fischer) in one of the greatest sitcom love stories.
A comedian on the improv circuit, Kemper was best known for viral internet sketches before joining The Office as new receptionist Erin Hannon when Pam moved into a sales job. She then went on to appear in films like Bridesmaids, The Secret Life of Pets, and 21 Jump Street, as well as TV series including The Mindy Project, Sofia the First, and Drunk History.
Trivia. 1  Pam is an accomplished volleyball player, a talent not revealed until the Company Picnic. 2  Since season 7 episode 2 Counseling Pam is the official office administrator. However, Pam lied to get the position as office administrator and was nearly caught by Gabe. Pam has the final talking head interview in the series, during which she delivers the final line of the series: There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things.
Since The Office ended, sheâs had recurring roles on several short-lived TV shows, including The Mysteries of Laura and You, Me, and the Apocalypse. She will next be seen in The 15:17 to Paris, Clint Eastwoodâs film based on the true story of a terrorist attack on a European train.

The package says that they are non-refillable pencils; the thought is that you use it till it runs out of lead and then it's trash. BUT! That is a lie! You can refill them and I encourage you to do so. This video explains how to refill the pencil, complete with close-ups. Don't throw them away, refill them!
This might sound stupid for all of you experienced users of mechanical pencils but...... first time user of a mechanical pencil(Pentel P205)-I have just used up my first piece of lead and need to refill it. BUT I can't figure it out. The lead will not stay in the opening.
I hate regular wood pencils and I don't like those expensive refillable pencils either. I also don't like any mechanical pencil where you click the eraser part to bring out more 'lead'. For example, I tried one by BIC with the clicky eraser and I hated it including how it felt in my hand.
I lost the instructions and can't understand how to refill this mechanical pencil. The end where the lead comes out keeps falling off. The back end where the eraser is located will not stay inside the barrel. There is a little spring, but the pieces do not work together at all.
It's the only one I use. I hate regular wood pencils and I don't like those expensive refillable pencils either.

RE: How do you refill a Papermate Sharpwriter mechanical pencil? It&#39;s one of those pencils that retracts or advances lead by twisting the portion at the bottom, but I don&#39;t know how to refill it. It&#39;s got a spring and this little black lead holder thing inside, which holds only one piece of lead at a time.
How to remove oil Based Paste Ink: Hairspray is your best bet on this one! Lay the stain face down on a clean cloth or paper towel. Spray the back of the stain with an alcohol-based hairspray until it is wet and push the stain through the fabric, replacing the cloth or paper towel underneath as it absorbs the ink.
You can refill them and I encourage you to do so. This video explains how to refill the pencil, complete with close-ups. Don't throw them away, refill them! Remember, the Paper-Mate Sharpwriter pencil uses 0.7mm lead. Standard Pentel lead will work excellent. The video was recorded with a Sony EVO-210 Video 8 8mm VCR.
. . as with someone in 2006, I cannot refill my Sensa Mechanical pencil. I know how to refill the lead container inside. But but earlier reading suggested that is a not an autorefill. But I cannot get lead to to insert from the writing end.
To refill your PhD Multi Pen just unscrew barrel at grip area (squeeze grip &amp; turn barrel counter clockwise), pull out empty refill or lead tube, replace refill (for pencil, place no more than two 0.5mm leads in lead tube and replace) by pushing it firmly into the empty slot, reattach grip to barrel.

Astrocytes B. Dendritic cells C. Langerhans cells D. T lymphocytes E. B lymphocytes Option D (T lymphocytes) is correct. Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) are found primarily in the skin, lymph nodes, spleen and thymus. They may also be present throughout the diffuse lymphoid system.
Main articles: T cell and B cell. T cells (thymus cells) and B cells (bone marrow-or bursa-derived cells) are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response. T cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B cells are primarily responsible for humoral immunity (relating to antibodies). The function of T cells and B cells is to recognize specific ânon-selfâ antigens, during a process known as antigen presentation.
Primary lymphoid tissues are the tissues in which lymphocytes are generated and differentiateinto mature naive naÃ¯ve: lymphocytes these are the bone marrow For b, cells and the bone marrow andthe thymus For t; cells they will be discussed In chapter. 7
Inlymph nodes (a) , spleen (b) and the Peyerâspatches of the small intestine (c) , the B cellzones are seen as defined follicles; functionallyequivalent areas, not all as well defined, arefound in all mucosal lymphoid tissues.Proliferating B cells are concentrated in thegerminal centers.
Secondary lymphoid tissues arethe tissues in which immune responses are initiated, and the lymphatic vessels that connectthem to the tissues and the bloodstream and thus to sites of infection (Figure 1-18).
Conversely, at sites of chronic inflammation, organized lymphoid tissue mayform: this is known as tertiary lymphoid tissue. Overview of the Immune Response Chapter 1 15 Figure 1-19 Secondary lymphoid tissues Thespecialized sites of T cell activation are coloredpurple; the sites of B cell activation are blue.
They include natural killer cells (NK cells) (which function in cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity), T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity), and B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity). They are the main type of cell found in lymph, which prompted the name lymphocyte.
B Lymphocytes â¢ Develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. â¢ Produce antibodies with specificity for antigens. â¢ Plasma cells = Activated B cells. â¢ Upon activation, a B cell can switch to produce a different class of antibody, with the same antigen specificity.
The three major types of lymphocyte are T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Lymphocytes can be identified by their large nucleus.
The T cell regions (purple)are adjacent to the B cell follicles. In the spleen,these form the periarteriolar lymphatic sheaths(PALS) and are surrounded by a region knownas the marginal zone, which we describe in thenext section.

Small bikes are the future. They are, arguably, more fun as the limit is the bike â not rider ability. Donât get me wrong â you can still hurt your self â but there is nothing like ringing a lil bikeâs neck while finding your limit and the bikeâs limit. ENJOY!! Your comment is nonsense, almost in its entirety.
A grom or grommet isnt necessarly a biginner surfer but a YOUNG surfer... usually under the age of 15. Most of the time people that are called groms are youngins who RIP (are good).
No one in their right mind is going to recommend that you go out and drag knees or do burnouts, stoppies or wheelies on the street on a Gixxer 1k OR a Ninja 300. Certainly no responsible journalist is going to recommend that especially for an âentry-level riderâ.
I own a R1 and I would love to rag this little thing out! I love the R1, donât get me wrong, it is incredible, but the Grom just looks like pure fun. â¦this isnât âa small bikeâ. Itâs not even a big moped. Itâs a medium-sized step-through with footpegs.

The Mongols invaded Central Europe with three armies. One army defeated an alliance which included forces from fragmented Poland and members of various Christian military orders, led by Henry II the Pious, Duke of Silesia in the battle of Legnica.
The British Empire used to be pretty darned big. It was said that the sun never set on England (and it still might not). A new map is making the rounds that shows the places where the British have invaded. Of the nearly 200 countries out there, the Brits have invaded all but 22. That is just about 90% of all countries! Mongolia, the Ivory Coast, Bolivia and Sweden are among the selective group of making it to 2013 without a British invasion. Here is the map showing where (pink) the British have invaded. The data comes from the new book All the Countries Weâve Ever Invaded: And the Few We Never Got Round To. Author Stuart Laycock went through the history of every country in the world to see where the Brits invaded.
Chinese Invasion from the South. On 11 October, the Chinese began to invade Mongolia from the south, in order to gain the territory which was provided to them through the Khabavorsk Pact. The Chinese forces advanced virtually unopposed into Mongolia from the south.
Regardless of their reasons, the Mongols had completely withdrawn from Central Europe by mid-1242, though they still launched military operations in the west at this time, most notably the 1241â1243 Mongol invasion of Anatolia.
I cannot say to what extent the list of countries supposed to have been invaded by the Brits is accurate, but should we accept it, the countries in the list below would be the candidates for nations never invaded.
The Soviet-Mongolian War was a conflict between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Mongolia which began on 7 October, 1967, 50 years after the October Revolution. Though Mongolia was a communist state, democratic uprisings had been sweeping through the nation beginning that summer. The Soviets desired to put these uprisings down. Also, the Soviets greatly desired the oil and mineral rich lands on which Mongolia rests.
According to a book by Stuart Laycock most of the countries in the world have at one point or another been invaded by the British*. The question is not specifically about being invaded by them, but the list might narrow down the number candidates.
Mongol invasion of Hungary. The Mongol invasion of Europe in the 13th century was the military effort by an Asian power, the Mongols, to invade and conquer Europe. It involved the severe and rampant destruction of East Slavic principalities and major cities, such as Kiev and Vladimir.
Warring European princes realized they had to cooperate in the face of a threatened Mongol invasion, so local wars and conflicts were suspended in parts of central Europe, only to be resumed after the Mongols had withdrawn.
Generally, it is countries that act as a buffer state between great-powers that remain uninvaded. Two perfect examples of this are. 1) Mongolia - between USSR and China. 2) Nepal - between British East India and China. Other than this there are very few to no countries that have never been ruled by foreigners.

âI think that when you say âaseptic technique,â a lot of people automatically think âoperating roomâ or âsurgical procedure,ââ explains Kathleen Meehan Arias, MS, CIC, president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and director of Arias Infection Control Consulting LLC.
Applying Aseptic Technique in all Clinical Settings. The practice of aseptic technique isnât solely isolated to the operating room. The practice has a place in every clinical setting. As the mother of a neutropenic infant, many facets of aseptic technique and infection prevention encircle all aspects of my daily life.
Applying Aseptic Technique in all Clinical Settings. By Jennifer Schraag. The practice of aseptic technique isnât solely isolated to the operating room. The practice has a place in every clinical setting. As the mother of a neutropenic infant, many facets of aseptic technique and infection prevention encircle all aspects of my daily life.
Aseptic techniques are those that do some or all of the following:Â¹ Remove or kill microorganisms from hands and objects Employ sterile instruments and other items Reduce a patientâs risk of exposure to microorganisms Arias points out that all aspects of aseptic technique are part of infection prevention procedures.
Handwashing. 1  Surgical scrub. 2  Using barriers (personal protective equipment) 3  Patient prep. 4  Maintaining the sterile field. 5  Using safe operative technique (making small incisions, avoiding trauma to tissue and surrounding structures, and controlling bleeding) 6  Maintaining a safer environment in the surgical/procedure area.
âA lot of people donât think of handwashing as being aseptic technique, but itâs the first step in any procedure involving aseptic technique â wash your hands then put a pair of gloves on.â Glove use is important and gloves must be used appropriately.
C, The palm of the glove is placed on the palm of the dominant hand. D, The bottom part of the cuff is grasped with the fingers of the dominant hand. E, The non-dominant hand grasps the top part of the cuff and pulls it over the dominant hand. F, The gloved hand then picks up the other glove.
I had received this article assignment just prior to our admission and I was determining the best approach to take; ultimately, I realized that stressing the importance of applying aseptic technique in all clinical settings was an important topic to cover.
Aseptic techniques are those that do some or all of the following:Â¹. 1  Remove or kill microorganisms from hands and objects. 2  Employ sterile instruments and other items. 3  Reduce a patientâs risk of exposure to microorganisms.
[edit on Wikidata] The epineurium is the outermost layer of dense irregular connective tissue surrounding a peripheral nerve. It usually surrounds multiple nerve fascicles as well as blood vessels which supply the nerve. Smaller branches of these blood vessels penetrate into the perineurium.
Adorable animal families that will make you aww. The perineurium is a protective layer of tissue located around nerves in the body and the internal organs. It is composed of concentric layers of connective tissue that form a protective sheath around bundles of nerve fibers.
Small nerves might comprise a single funiculus, but in case of large nerves, the funiculi join to form large bundles of nerve fibers called fasciculi. These are kept together by membranous sheaths or layers of connective tissue called endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium. The epineurium is a sense layer of connective tissue that envelops the entire nerve trunk. It surrounds the fascicles and the blood vessels that supply the nerve.

The layer of the epineurium that extends within the nerve to define the fascicles is termed the internal epineurium. Together, these two layers form the epineurium, which varies in thickness along the course of a nerve. The epineurium is usually most abundant around joints, as its function is to protect the nerves from stretching and subsequent injury.
In case of the peripheral nerves, Schwann cells that are wrapped around the nerve fibers produce a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin insulates the axons. Endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium are layers of connective tissue that cover the individual axons, fascicle, and the entire nerve, respectively. It must be noted that both myelinated and unmyelinated axons have an endoneurium.

The Internship Program is based in the Career Services Center, which is responsible for program operations and management via the centerâs Internship Coordinator. Faculty internship sponsors supervise the academic component of internships and evaluate the studentsâ internship experiences.
They also have specialized offices and employees whose primary responsibility is to help you get a job. Use them! Many of the advantages of college internships can also be realized through campus jobs and by getting in with alums who have been where you are at, and can help you get to where you want to be.
10 Benefits of Starting an Internship Program. Find future employees. An internship program is a year-round recruiting tool. Fall internships, summer internships, semester internships, and quarterly internships, implementing an internship program means you have an ongoing pipeline of future fulltime employees. For many, the process of recruiting and hiring is a drain on company resources.
2. Student Intern: A student registered for an academic or non-academic internship credit and involved in a work/learn experience. 3. Internship Director: The individual who coordinates the Sweet Briar College Internship Program.
College internships are a great way to address both of those issues at the same time. As such, the importance of internships to college students demands serious consideration.
In addition to information and resources regarding college internships, CollegeView also offers the following information to help students prepare for college: 1  College Life Quotes.
Students may earn a total of 3 credits per semester per employment site, and a maximum total of 6 credits per semester per employment site with the approval of a faculty sponsor. A maximum of 12 credits of internship can be applied to the Sweet Briar undergraduate degree.
And college internships are great for this. The importance of internships to college students in terms of networking and gaining new resources cannot be understated. Building a network of âwho you knowsâ through college student internships can pay great dividends upon graduation.
8. Academic Internship Sponsor Contact Form: A form with contact information for the intern and on-site supervisor. 9. Warning, Waiver, Covenant, and Release of Liability and Agreement to Participate: Outlines the studentâs willingness to participate in the internship knowing the risks and conditions involved.
There are a variety of ways of evaluating a studentâs progress and achievement in the internship. These include an evaluation of work by the on-site supervisor, a studentâs self-evaluation, a visit to the work site by the faculty sponsor, and specific academic requirements fulfilled by the student.
Tonic Water. Just because it contains the word water in its name and is carbonated doesn't mean that tonic water is in the same category as bubbly waters. Unlike the other carbonated options, tonic water has a distinct flavor and it certainly can't be swapped out (or in) for carbonated water. Tonic water is a bitter drink (a result of the addition of quinine) which pairs particularly well with gin.
Winner: Soda Water. Fizz check! Tonic water contains 83 calories and 21.5 grams of sugar, while soda water contains zero. That's almost as much calories and sugar in tonic water as a regular cola soda (90 calories; 25g sugar)! Water is not created equal.
In fact, vodka's neutral taste does account for much of its appeal: It mixes equally well with tonic water and tomato juice, and it can be as crisp and corporate as James Bond's vodka martinis or as trashy as the swamp waters my local bartender mixes (made of vodka and Mountain Dew).

Vodka tonic. A vodka tonic is an alcoholic drink made with varying proportions of vodka and tonic water. Vodka tonics are frequently garnished with a slice of lime or lemon. One commonly used recipe is one part vodka and one part tonic water in a tumbler over ice, with a generous lime wedge squeezed into it. Navigation menu.

A few states have no corporate income tax, and a few other states have no personal income tax. Apart from taxing business income through a corporate income tax or a personal income tax, many states impose a separate tax on at least some businesses, sometimes called a âfranchise taxâ or âprivilege tax.â
The tax must be paid to a state that does not allow California residents a credit against taxes imposed by that state. See California Schedule S for a listing of the applicable states. The income must have its source in the other state. California law and its associated case decisions are the authority for the determination of the source of income, or any matter affecting the computation regardless of any provision or interpretation of the law of the other state.
The tax must be paid to a state that allows California residents a credit against taxes imposed by that state. See California Schedule S for a listing of the applicable states. The same income must be taxed by both states. Generally, income that is taxed by California and the other state will be the same amounts.
California corporations without taxable income are subject to Californiaâs franchise tax. California corporations with taxable income are subject to the stateâs corporate income tax and, potentially, the stateâs alternative minimum tax. Example: For the latest tax year, your California corporation had taxable net income of $100,000.

California is unusual among the states in that, while it does recognize the federal S election, it does not treat S corporations as pass-through entities for state tax purposes. Instead, California requires S corporations to pay a 1.5% franchise tax on income, with a minimum tax of $800.
There was only one saving grace for the Ultimate universe and the promise it had once held: Bendisâs Ultimate Spider-Man stories. Bendis was Marvelâs golden boy, and although his stories acknowledged that Ultimatum happened, Quesada never forced him to change the optimistic tone of his beloved series.
The imprint was launched in 2000 with the publication of the series Ultimate Spider-Man and Ultimate X-Men, providing new original stories for the characters. The Marvel Multiverse, which comprises an infinite number of galaxies and alternate universes, calls this universe Earth-1610.
Ultimate Universe. Ultimate Universe. In this reality, with some exceptions, Earth was all but devoid of heroes until very late in the 20th Century. At this time, a sudden upsurge in accidentally, and sometimes purposefully, powered individuals drove the public into an increased state of paranoia and anxiety.

The history of Ultimate Marvel is, in a way, a story about warring approaches to a reboot: Bendisâs and Millarâs. Bendis wanted to polish the old archetypes; Millar wanted to aggressively critique them. Bendis sought timeless stories; Millar craved biting contemporary political critique.
Ultimate Marvel, later known as Ultimate Comics, was an imprint of comic books published by Marvel Comics, featuring re-imagined and updated versions of the company's superhero characters from the Ultimate Universe. Those characters include Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.
Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate X-Men, The Ultimates, and the newly launched Ultimate Fantastic Four all existed in the same universe, meaning the sleek, Ultimate versions of Marvelâs characters were all hanging out with one another in their own little pocket of fiction.

Guanajuato (Spanish pronunciation: [gwanaËxwato]), officially the Free and Sovereign State of Guanajuato (Spanish: Estado Libre y Soberano de Guanajuato), is one of the 31 states which, with the Federal District, are the 32 Federal entities of Mexico. It is divided into 46 municipalities and its capital city is Guanajuato.
The Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) became effective January 1, 1987. All Federal civilian employees hired after this date are covered under FERS. FERS retirement eligibility is based on years of service and minimum retirement age (MRA).
Note: There is an exception to this â5-year testâ for employees who were covered under CSRS prior to Jan. 1, 1984 and another exception for employees of the D.C. Govt. who were covered under CSRS prior to Oct. 1, 1987 that will not be addressed in this article.
CSRS Offset coverage was effectively introduced in 1987 (the same time that FERS was effectively introduced). FERS and CSRS Offset coverage exists today primarily because of some Social Security amendments that were passed by Congress in the mid-1980s.
Congress created the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) in 1986, and it became effective on January 1, 1987. Since that time, new Federal civilian employees who have retirement coverage are covered by FERS. Civil Service employees pay Social Security taxes and contribute to the Basic Benefit Plan.
Federal Employee Retirement System - FERS. DEFINITION of 'Federal Employee Retirement System - FERS'. A system that became effective in 1987 and replaced the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) as the primary retirement plan for U.S. federal civilian employees.
However, as in the example above, if the employee under CSRS Interim had at least 5 years of potentially creditable service as of Dec. 31, 1986, then they should have been converted to CSRS Offset (with the option to elect FERS).
Determine Your FERS Eligibility. Congress created the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) in 1986, and it became effective on January 1, 1987. Since that time, new Federal civilian employees who have retirement coverage are covered by FERS. The FERS plan consists of three parts:
Eligibility and payment amounts are based on age, years of service and contributions to the plan. Although less generous than CSRS was, FERS is more generous than many corporate plans. Federal employees hired after 1983 are automatically covered by FERS, rather than CSRS. Civil Service Retirement System ...
Before FERS and CSRS Offset became effective on Jan. 1, 1987, an employee who initially obtained a federal position eligible for retirement coverage between Jan. 1, 1984 and Dec. 31, 1986 was given temporary retirement coverage called CSRS Interim.

While any whole grain is good, so-called ancient grains are even better, according to Reardon, because they're less likely to be man-modified and processed. Packaged, processed, and refined foods made with wheat flour and sugar, in contrast, tend to be digested quickly, causing cause blood sugar to spike.
Why they help: There's a reason fish is known as brain food.. Fatty fish such as wild salmon contain the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, which has been shown to increase the membrane quality and nerve function of gray matter in the brain.
The human femur can resist forces of 1,800 to 2,500 pounds, so it is not easily fractured. A break in this bone can only result from a large amount of force, such as a car accident or a fall from an extreme height. Such an injury can take three to six months to heal. Back to Leg.

Femur. The femur is the only bone located within the human thigh. It is both the longest and the strongest bone in the human body, extending from the hip to the knee. Important features of this bone include the head, medial and lateral condyles, patellar surface, medial and lateral epicondyles, and greater and lesser trochanters.
The human skeleton is the internal framework of the body. It is composed of 270 bones at birth â this total decreases to 206 bones by adulthood after some bones have fused together. The bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum density around age 30. The human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column, the rib cage and the skull.
The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee joint.
The femur (/ËfiËmÉr/) (pl. femurs or femora (/ËfÉmÉrÉ/)), or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the center of the body) bone of the leg in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs.
The human skeleton serves six major functions; support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of ions and endocrine regulation.
Structure [edit]. The femur is the only bone in the thigh. The two femurs converge medially toward the knees, where they articulate with the proximal ends of the tibiae. The angle of convergence of the femora is a major factor in determining the femoral-tibial angle.
The femur is categorised as a long bone and comprises a diaphysis, the shaft (or body) and two epiphysis or extremities that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee.
II. Basic Elements Of Protein Structure A. Helices. The Î±-helix is the classic element of protein structure. A single Î±-helix can order as many as 35 residues whereas the longest Î² strands include only about 15 residues, and one helix can have more influence on the stability and organization of a protein than any other individual structure element.
A. Helices. 1  The Î±-helix is the classic element of protein structure. A single Î±-helix can order as many as 35 residues whereas the longest Î² strands include only about 15 residues, and one helix can have more influence on the stability and organization of a protein than any other individual structure element.
Alpha Helices. The alpha helix is a rod-like structure whose inner section is formed by a tightly coiled main chain, with its side chains extending outward in a helical array. The alpha helix structure takes advantage of the hydrogen bond between CO and NH groups of the main chain to stabilize. The CO group of each amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the NH group of amino acid four residues earlier in the sequence.
The only other principal helical species besides the Î±-helix which occurs to any great extent in globular protein structure is the 3 10-helix (see Fig. 17), with a three-residue repeat and a hydrogen bond to residue n + 3 instead of n + 4.
backbone is coiled up like a very tight clockwise screw thread or the cord of a telephone. The peptide link plates form the wall of the tube with the Ca atoms projecting a little from the surface. The side chain groups, attached to the Ca atoms, project outwards from the wall of the tube (figure 8).
A level chemistry resource. Protein structure The a-helix. Secondary structure (continued) We can describe the arrangement of a
The right-handed Î±-helix is the most common secondary structure found in protein, with 3.6 amino acid residues observed per turn of the helix (Fig. 4-5).
Handedness is an enormously influential parameter in protein structure; most features for which handedness can be defined prefer one sense to the other, and the Î±-helix is only the first of many examples we will encounter.
The a-helix. 3.2 Secondary structure (continued) We can describe the arrangement of atoms around the peptide link (the conformation) by giving the degree and direction in which the Ca-CO and N-Ca bonds are rotated. When a number of successive peptide links have identical rotations the polypeptide chain takes up a particular secondary structure. There are several types of secondary structure, but we will concentrate on just two: the a-helix and the b-pleated sheet. In both cases you will see how the regular conformation allows the structure to be stabilised by forming many relatively strong hydrogen bonds. The a-helix The a-helix is like a narrow-bore tube.
The helix dipole may contribute to the binding of charged species to the protein: for example, negative nucleotide phosphates, which are typically found near the N-termini of helices. FIG. 17. A short segment of 310 helix from carbonic anhydrase (residues 159-164). Main chain carbonyl oxygens are shown as open circles.
Thus, a drop in the price level decreases the interest rate, which increases the demand for investment and thereby increases aggregate demand. The third reason for the downward slope of the aggregate demand curve is Mundell-Fleming's exchange-rate effect.
(This is known as the law of demand.). In contrast, the aggregate demand curve used in macroeconomics shows the relationship between the overall (i.e. average) price level in an economy, usually represented by the GDP Deflator, and the total amount of all goods demanded in an economy.
The first reason for the downward slope of the aggregate demand curve is Pigou's wealth effect. Recall that the nominal value of money is fixed, but the real value is dependent upon the price level. This is because for a given amount of money, a lower price level provides more purchasing power per unit of currency.
DEFINITION of 'Aggregate Demand'. The total amount of goods and services demanded in the economy at a given overall price level and in a given time period. It is represented by the aggregate-demand curve, which describes the relationship between price levels and the quantity of output that firms are willing to provide. Normally there is a negative relationship between aggregate demand and the price level. Also known as total spending.
The most noticeable feature of the aggregate demand curve is that it is downward sloping, as seen in. There are a number of reasons for this relationship. Recall that a downward sloping aggregate demand curve means that as the price level drops, the quantity of output demanded increases. Similarly, as the price level drops, the national income increases. There are three basic reasons for the downward sloping aggregate demand curve.
(Note that goods in this context technically refers to both goods and services.) Specifically, the aggregate demand curve shows real GDP, which, in equilibrium, represents both total output and total income in an economy, on its horizontal axis.
Students learn in microeconomics that the demand curve for a good, which shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of the good that consumers demand-i.e. are willing, ready, and able to purchase-has a negative slope.
Aggregate demand is the demand for the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country, and is represented by this formula: Aggregate Demand (AD) = C + I + G + (X-M) C = Consumers' expenditures on goods and services. I = Investment spending by companies on capital goods.
Therefore, the aggregate demand curve must slope downwards for different reasons. In fact, there are three reasons why the aggregate demand curve exhibits this pattern: the wealth effect, the interest-rate effect, and the exchange-rate effect.
(Technically, in the context of aggregate demand, the Y on the horizontal axis represents aggregate expenditure .) As it turns out, the aggregate demand curve also slopes downwards, giving a similar negative relationship between price and quantity that exists with the demand curve for a single good.
Niger has an extremely low literacy rate at 28.7%. However, the gender gap between males and females is a major problem for the country, males have a literacy rate of 42.9% and females a literacy rate of 15.1%. The Nigerien government defines literacy as anyone who can read or write over the age of 15.

There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Most presented rates are based on the ability to read and write at a specified age. Information on literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world.
The literacy rate in Kenya among people below 20 years of age is over 70%, as the first 8 years of primary school are provided tuition-free by the government. In January 2008, the government began offering a restricted program of free secondary education.
Senegal has a literacy rate of 49.7%; the government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 years of age and over who can read and write. However, many students do not attend school long enough to be considered literate.

Often, the first test used to diagnose anemia is a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC measures many parts of your blood. This test checks your hemoglobin and hematocrit (hee-MAT-oh-crit) levels. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood. A low level of hemoglobin or hematocrit is a sign of anemia.
To evaluate your body's current level of iron. When your doctor suspects that you may have too little or too much iron in your system. A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm. Your doctor may request that you fast for 12 hours prior to some iron tests; in this case, only water is permitted.
Transferrin level, or total iron-binding capacity. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in your blood. Total iron-binding capacity measures how much of the transferrin in your blood isn't carrying iron. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, you'll have a high level of transferrin that has no iron.
The amount of ferritin in the blood (serum ferritin level) is directly related to the amount of iron stored in your body. Iron is important for red blood cell production. Your doctor may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of anemia due to low iron.
Ferritin blood test. The ferritin blood test measures the level of ferritin in the blood. Ferritin is a protein found inside cells that stores iron so your body can use it later. A ferritin test indirectly measures the amount of iron in your blood. A blood sample is needed.
Hemoglobin, serum iron, TIBC or UIBC and serum ferritin are sufficient to establish a basic picture of oneâs iron status, but in conditions of disease that may be due to blood cell production or cancers, other tests or procedures are needed to determine the cause for abnormal iron levels.
We are now offering Direct-to-Consumer Blood Tests! Iron Disorders Institute (IDI), in partnership with its affiliate Health-e-Iron LLC, are now offering direct-to-consumer lab tests. Test vouchers can be purchased online in 45 participating states and the District of Columbia.
A fasting serum iron and IBC are needed to calculate the transferrin-iron saturation percentage (TS%) Calculating TS%: Fasting* serum iron Ã· TIBC X 100%= transferrin-iron saturation percentage (TS%) *Fasting is nothing by mouth (except water or prescribed medications) after midnight or at least 5 hours before tests.
Hemoglobin measures functional iron. This iron delivers oxygen to cells and carries carbon dioxide away from cells. Serum iron: is a test that measures the iron level in your blood. Serum ferritin is often referred to as the bodyâs place for storing iron.
For this test, a sample of your blood is examined under a microscope. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, your red blood cells will look smaller and paler than normal. Tests to measure iron levels. These tests can show how much iron has been used from your body's stored iron.
The protein is shorter than usual and does not contain all the amino acids that it should. Therefore, this protein is most likely nonfunctional. Frameshift Mutations Another type of mutation is a frameshift mutation which is caused by the insertion or a deletion of a base pair. An inserted or deleted nucleotide alters the triplet grouping of nucleotides into codons and shifts the reading frame so that all nucleotides downstream from the mutation will be improperly grouped.
So, the 2 types of frameshift mutations are insertion & deletion. A frameshift is always serious, because the entire genetic code is messed up from the point of insertion/deletion onward. A point mutation means that 1 single base is altered.
A point mutation will change only one particular base of the codon, so it will only cause a change in one of the amino acids that will make up the protein. A deletion mutatiâ¦on will completely remove a base- causing a change in every amino acid that follows the deletion.

point mutation has transition (when a purine base is substituted with another purine or pyramidine with pyramidine) or transversion (purine with pyramidine or vice versa) point mutations give rise to silent mutation, nonsense mutation and missense mutation. silent mutations are the least harmful cause their change of the base does not result in anything cause they code for the same amino acid. missense codes for a different amino acid, and nonsense codes for a stop codon.
a framshift mutation does not occur in multiples of threes. if you know, three nucleotide makes up an amino acid. so if there are a deletion or insertion in the middle, that means that all the nucleotides from that mutation on is 'shifted' in a very incorrect fashion. frameshift mutation is thus very harmful.
A point mutation is a change in a single base pair in DNA. A change in a single nitrogenous base can change the entire structure of a protein because a change in a single aminâ¦o acid can affect the shape of the protein. A frameshift mutation is a mutation in which a single base is added or deleted from DNA.
Frameshift mutation. A frameshift mutation (also called a framing error or a reading frame shift) is a genetic mutation caused by indels (insertions or deletions) of a number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence that is not divisible by three.
Insertion mutations can affect many amino acids in the protein. An insertion mutation usually causes more defects during protein  synthesis than point mutation because an insâ¦ertion mutation will  affect many amino acids in the protein.

The boundaries of the Republic of West Florida included all territory south of the 31st parallel, west of the Pearl River, and east of the Mississippi River, but north of Lake Pontchartrain. The southern boundary was the Gulf of Mexico.
In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson purchased the territory of Louisiana from the French government for $15 million. The Louisiana Purchase stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and from Canada to New Orleans, and it doubled the size of the United States.
1 Connecticut put forth a claim to a swath of land from its western boundary to the Mississippi River. 2  A claim to a portion of Pennsylvania (not shown on the map) was asserted only half-heartedly because of the strength of a more recent charter held by that state.
1 Connecticut and New York jointly claimed lands in the Old Northwest, but New York surrendered its rights in 1785 and Connecticut followed the next year. 2  However, Connecticut's claim to an area known as the Western Reserve was maintained until 1795, when it was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company. 3  Massachusetts.
1 A portion of this claim was added to northern Georgia and the remainder was ceded to the central government. 2  Georgia. 3  Georgia, possessor of the weakest claim to western lands, held out the longest. 4  The area that later became Alabama and Mississippi were given up in 1802, which completed the process of surrender.
West Florida was a region on the north shore of the Gulf of Mexico, which underwent several boundary and sovereignty changes during its history. The province was established by the British in 1763 out of lands ceded from the Spanish and French.
The claims to the western lands were usually rooted in the vague wording of old colonial charters. The picture was further complicated by the fact that the claims often overlapped one another, which pitted one state's interests against another.
This was soon annexed by the United States, which claimed the region as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. In 1819 the United States negotiated the purchase of the remainder of West Florida and all of East Florida in the AdamsâOnis OnÃ­s, treaty and in 1822 both were merged into The Florida. territory
As its name suggests, it was formed out of the Western part of formerly Spanish Florida (East Florida formed the eastern part), along with lands taken from French Louisiana; West Florida's capital was Pensacola.
Western Land Claims. Americans of the Revolutionary Era regarded the West as those lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. The area beyond the Mississippi was then largely unexplored and in the possession of foreign powers.

When Will Baby Sleep in Their Bed? The reality is that your newborn is unlikely to sleep inside the the charming crib that you spent an entire day assembling until she is 6 months or older. Further your newborn should and probably will be sleeping with you IN YOUR ROOM for about the first 6 months.
You should establish this bedtime habit early, when newborns are biologically programmed to fall asleep right after eating. Feed your baby, burp him, rock for a few minutes (if desired), and put him to bed in the crib. If your baby wonât sleep in the crib, see our article on getting baby to sleep in the crib.
But babies donât know the difference between day and night. So they sleep with no regard for what time it is. That means your babyâs wide-awake time may be from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. By 3 to 6 months, many babies are able to sleep for a stretch of 6 hours.
Very young newborns might also benefit from a sleep hat to conserve body heat and mittens to prevent scratches during sleep. For safety and sleep training purposes, newborns should also do most of their sleeping in a baby crib or bassinet.
There are a number of compelling reasons for your baby to stay in your room for the first 6 months: 1  Safety. Numerous health organizations (such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, SIDS Alliance and NIH) suggest that the safest place for your newborn to sleep is in your room with you. 2  Convenience.
By Dr. William Sears. Having counseled thousands of parentsâand having been one myselfâfor some 40 years, when I'm asked where baby should sleep I simply answer, Wherever all family members sleep the best.. Some infants need more sleeping closeness in the early months; others later on as they go through the normal stage of nighttime separation anxiety.
There are basically four to six things you should put your newborn in for sleep. Top to bottom, they generally include a set of soft pajamas, a tightly-wrapped swaddler or sleep sack, and possibly a light blanket.
Newborns should get 14 to 17 hours of sleep over a 24-hour period, says the National Sleep Foundation. Some newborns may sleep up to 18 to 19 hours a day. Newborns wake every couple of hours to eat. Breastfed babies feed often, about 8 to 12 times a day. Bottle-fed babies tend to feed less often, about every 3 to 4 hours. Newborns who sleep for longer stretches should be awakened to feed.
Understand Your Baby's Sleep Needs. During the first 2 months, your newborn's need to eat overrules her need to sleep. She may feed almost every 2 hours if you're breastfeeding, and possibly a little less often if you bottle-feed. Your baby may sleep from 10 to 18 hours a day, sometimes for 3 to 4 hours at a time.

Ferris Bueller took his day off exactly 30 years ago today. The Internet exists for exactly this reason: In a four-year old post for Baseball Prospectus, Larry Granillo looked closely to determine exactly what Cubs game Ferris Bueller and his friends attended in the 1986 classic Ferris Buellerâs Day Off.
The movie âFerris Buellerâs Day Offâ was released on June 11, 1986. The ballgame then must have been filmed either real early in the 1986 season or sometime during 1985. Looking at game logs from those seasons, we see that there was no game in 1986 in which Lee Smith (#46) faced the Braves at Wrigley Field.
Domino's Pizza is going old school to tell a modern story about delivery. When Ferris Bueller's Day Off was released in 1986, clearly the title character did not have a smartwatch, a tablet or even a flatscreen TV.

About a dozen states have what are called no fault car insurance laws (District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Utah).
As of 2014, 12 states have some type of no-fault car insurance law, according to the III. 1  No-fault insurance required. This type of coverage is mandatory in Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota and Utah. 2  No-fault insurance optional.
New York is different from most other states in that it is a no-fault state for automobile accidents. According to the law, anyone who is injured in a car accident is entitled to recover for economic damages, up to a total of $50,000, from his or her insurance company. This includes lost wages and medical bills.
A no fault insurance claim, sometimes called a Personal Injury Protection claim (or PIP claim), is one you make against your own automobile insurer for payment of medical bills and lost earnings under your stateâs no fault laws.
Letâs say that you got into a car accident, in which the other driver was at fault, and with the following facts: 1  your stateâs no fault limit for medical bills is $5,000 for people with no health insurance, and $10,000 for people with health insurance.
What to do if You Are in a No-fault Car Accident. If youâve been injured in a car accident in New York, you have two options: you can file an insurance claim, or you can bring a civil action against the person who caused your injuries.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce swelling and soreness and are often used alone for mild to moderate pain. To manage the moderate to severe pain after surgery, NSAIDs are often used in combination with opioids.
Much to the dismay of the pharmaceutical industryâs best efforts, many patients are still seeking out natural solutions, like bromelain and quercetin supplements, to reduce inflammation after surgery or injury. Find out if this botanical combination is the best natural anti-inflammatory for you.
Many types of medicines are available to help control pain, including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and local anesthetics. Treating pain with medication can help you feel more comfortable, which will help your body heal and recover from surgery faster.
FDA has approved several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for dogs to control pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis; and to control pain and inflammation after soft tissue and orthopedic surgery. [Orthopedic pertains to bones and muscles; soft tissue is everything else.
While anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen are effective in the short-term, adding anti-inflammatory foods to the menu serves a dual purpose â controlling potentially deadly, low-grade inflammation and improving overall general health through lower caloric intake.
1 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 2  These are the most common medicines used to help manage rotator cuff disorders. 3  NSAIDs are available with or without a prescription. 4  NSAIDs come in pills and in a cream that you rub over the sore area.
Modern pain medications and anesthesia can control post-surgical pain and help your body heal. If you're having surgery, it's natural to have concerns â or even fears â about the pain following the procedure. Some pain is common after surgery, but you shouldn't have to endure severe pain.
Surgeons have long known about the anti-inflammatory properties of certain fruits and plants that are considered beneficial to intervene in the postoperative bruising and swelling process. The specific substances are bromelain and quercetin, which are found in pineapples, capers, apples, and red onions, to name a few.
Like NSAIDs, acetaminophen may be used after surgery to reduce the amount of stronger, opioid medications you need to control pain. Acetaminophen is often combined with opioid medicine in a tablet form. When taken in tablet form, opioids are not easily absorbed by the body.

Pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is a type of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection. It is relatively common and continues to pose significant therapeutic challenges. In addition, the role of MAC in pulmonary pathology remains controversial in many instances.
MAC is caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium avium complex. These bacteria are common in the environment. MAC can be found in soil, food, dust and water, and probably enters the body during breathing or when swallowing food or water. MAC is one of a number of infections that can develop in people who are living with HIV, called opportunistic infections.
People with HIV most at risk of developing MAC are those who: 1  have a CD4 count below 50 cells/mm3. 2  have a viral load over 100,000 copies/ml. 3  have previously had MAC or another opportunistic infection.
The most common findings of MAC infections include 1-2: 1  bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening: most common findings. 2  ground-glass opacities. 3  small centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud appearance. 4  patchy consolidation. 5  a predilection for the right middle lobe and lingula is seen particularly in elderly white women.

This section gives you the main meanings of many homonyms. It does not list every meaning. The simplified history of most words is explained in brief. There is a HUGE amount of information in this section to enrich your brain, so rummage around!
An acronym (pronounced AK-ruh-nihm, from Greek acro- in the sense of extreme or tip and onyma or name) is an abbreviation of several words in such a way that the abbreviation itself forms a pronounceable word. The word may already exist or it can be a new word.
In linguistics, a word is the smallest element that can be uttered in isolation with semantic or pragmatic content (with literal or practical meaning). This contrasts deeply with a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning but will not necessarily stand on its own.
The term word may refer to a spoken word or to a written word, or sometimes to the abstract concept behind either. Spoken words are made up of units of sound called phonemes, and written words of symbols called graphemes, such as the letters of the English alphabet.
An abbreviation is a shortening of a word or a phrase. An acronym is an abbreviation that forms a word. An initialism is an abbreviation that uses the first letter of each word in the phrase (thus, some but not all initialisms are acronyms).
Start Case. I too thought it is simply Title Case, until I read more in the Wikipedia article about letter cases - Letter case. Looks like Title Case does not capitalize certain parts of speech, (basically there are exceptions). A simple variant of that called Start Case, simply capitalize all the first letters of all the words.
An acronym in which one of the letters stands for the actual word abbreviated therein is called a recursive acronym. (For example, VISA is said to stand for VISA International Service Association.) An acronym in which the short form was original and words made up to stand for it afterwards is called a backronym.
The word for folder has an interesting history. It came into English in the 16th century from the French verb filer, to string on a thread. This relates to storing documents by tying them together with string. It comes from the Latin filum, meaning thread, from which we also get our word filament.
Best Answer: This depends... The example you gave is an Acronym because the phrase created is made of one word pieces that accurately reflect the meaning of the root word. Also a useful definition is Acrostic. An acrostic is usually a poem with phrases in place of the one word pieces of an acronym.
HOMONYMS  WORDS WITH MORE THAN ONE MEANING  WORDS WITH SEVERAL MEANINGS  WORDS WITH MULTIPLE MEANINGS. Homonyms. There is a strange puzzle in the English language  we have many words which have more than one meaning.

A cardinal's nest is a bulky structure of vines, leave and twigs. It is often hidden in a thicket. The nest is usually within ten feet of the ground. Three to four cardinal eggs will hatch after twelve days, and the fledglings leave the nest when they're between ten and twelve days old. Plant seeds and fruits comprise 90 percent of the cardinal's food in the fall and winter, and 40 to 50 percent of their food in the summer.
Nestlings and eggs are eaten by snakes, birds and small mammals. Predators of eggs and nestlings include milk snakes, black racers, pilot black snakes, blue jays, fox squirrels, red squirrels and eastern chipmunks. Brown-headed cowbirds also take cardinal eggs from the nest and sometimes eat them.
Cardinals, in the family Cardinalidae, are passerine birds found in North and South America. They are also known as cardinal-grosbeaks and cardinal-buntings. The South American cardinals in the genus Paroaria are placed in another family, the Thraupidae (previously placed in Emberizidae).
They are robust, seed-eating birds with strong bills. The family ranges in size from the 12-cm (4.7-in), 11.5-g (0.40-oz) and up orange-breasted bunting to the 25-cm (9.8-in), 85-g (2.99-oz) black-headed saltator. They are typically associated with open woodland. The sexes usually have distinctive appearances.
Cardinals are very adaptable. They are found in hardwood forest habitats, small rural and urban woodlots, farmstead, orchards and urban backyards. They do best where there is thick, shrubby growth for them to nest and roost in.
The female northern cardinal builds the nest and incubates the eggs. When the chicks hatch they have no feathers or down, so the female broods them to protect them and keep them warm for at least 2 days. Both parents feed the chicks a diet of insects.
Northern cardinals are found throughout eastern and central North America from southern Canada into parts of Mexico and Central America. These birds live as far north as Maine or Nova Scotia, Canada down south through Florida and the Gulf Coast. They range as far west as South Dakota, Nebraska and Texas. They have also been introduced to California, Hawaii and Bermuda. Northern cardinals do not migrate so they live in the same place year-round. (Halkin and Linville, 1999; Sibley, 2000)
Cardinals however, can be extremely skittish, shy and secretive when theyâre nesting. So, although Duncraft has just introduced a nesting shelf specifically for Cardinals, it may take a while for your cardinals to discover the benefits of building their nest in one.
As low as $29.99. The Cardinal is probably one of the most recognizable and popular backyard birds because of its brilliant red color and crested head. It is a great bird to admire year-round. The color contrast of the brilliant red against fresh white snow really is a high point during the winter months. Early settlers were said to have named this bird after the Cardinals of the Catholic Church who wore red robes.
We think Duncraftâs Cardinal House will do just that! With a little luck, our finicky Cardinals may come to learn that the nesting shelves we provide for them are sturdy, dry and provide a secure platform for their nests. In time, the birds may become less wary of them. Safer nests will help to ensure the future of this beautiful bird! âR.

There are many more things you should know about COBRA. Here are 10. 1. Certain qualifying events trigger 36 months of COBRA coverage for your dependents. Voluntary or involuntary job loss (except in instances of gross misconduct) triggers 18 months of COBRA coverage for you and your dependents.
If you choose to take Cobra coverage, you must keep the health plan you had before you lost your job. After you are in Cobra, you can switch plans â if you should want lower-cost coverage, for instance â when the companyâs active employees go through open enrollment.
You have to have Health Insurance in 2014 and forward. If you do not have health insurance (specifically Qualified Health Plan â QHP) you will pay a penalty (tax). The penalty for 2014 is the greater of $95 or 1% of house hold income reported on last yearâs tax statement (the penalty will increase in 2015, and 2016).
Because of that, only a relatively small share of employees who are eligible for Cobra benefits generally choose to take them. However, if you were laid off between Sept. 1, 2008, and the end of 2009, you might qualify for a federal subsidy that would help you pay to keep workplace health insurance for nine months.
When does COBRA continuation coverage start. COBRA is always effective the day after your active coverage ends. For most, active coverage terminates at the end of a month and COBRA is effective on the first day of the next month.
Effective for all health plans with plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act prohibits health insurance issuers from limiting or excluding coverage related to pre-existing health conditions, regardless of the age of the covered individual.
Under COBRA, if you voluntarily resign from a job or are terminated for any reason other than gross misconduct you are guaranteed the right to continue your former employer's group plan as individual or family health care coverage for up to 18 months, at your own expense.
The protection generally lasts up to 18 months, and you must opt for Cobra within 60 days of losing your job or of receiving formal notification that you are eligible for the program, whichever is later. The statute includes only companies with 20 or more employees that are continuing to offer a health plan.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contains a provision that gives qualified COBRA participants a 65 percent federal subsidy to pay their COBRA premiums for up to fifteen months. You can take advantage of this assistance if you became eligible for COBRA from Sept. 1, 2008, to May 31, 2010. This applies to workers (and their spouses and dependents) who were involuntarily terminated (including those laid off) or had a reduction in work hours that led to loss of health insurance benefits.
COBRA Premiums. COBRA is not an insurance company nor is it health insurance. COBRA is an abbreviation for a federal regulation that governs how and when a qualified beneficiary can continue terminated group health insurance coverage for a specified period of time by self-paying the premium.
Why did the Dodo go Extinct. The dodo was a large flightless bird was native to the Island of Mauritius (located to the east of Africa and Madagascar). This species is best known for becoming extinct in the 17th century, with the last sighting of this species in 1688.
A video of what looks like a living specimen has a lot of people wondering and hoping. The Myanmar Jerdonâs babbler (Chrysomma altirostre) was discovered by British naturalist T. C. Jerdon in 1862, when the sparrow-sized birds were common in the Ayeyarwady and Sittaung river floodplains.
Thatâs what was said about the Myanmar Jerdonâs babbler, which was declared extinct after not having been seen since 1941. Last week, researchers confirmed that several adult Jerdonâs babblers were seen early last year. Could the dodo bird be found alive too?
Why did the Dodo go Extinct. 19 Sep, 2013 animals 2. The dodo was a large flightless bird was native to the Island of Mauritius (located to the east of Africa and Madagascar). This species is best known for becoming extinct in the 17th century, with the last sighting of this species in 1688.
While familiarity with extinct animals varies, the dodo bird and the woolly mammoth can be considered generally well-known. The phrase to go the way of the dodo is a common reminder of the bird's extinction. The woolly mammoth went extinct in prehistoric times but still makes scientific headlines.
When did the dodo become extinct? As of 2015, the generally accepted date of extinction for the dodo is 1662, the date of the last reliable sighting. However, reports of sightings exist up through the end of the 1600s. Some date the extinction to 1681, due to an account of dodos hunted and eaten on Mauritius.
The evidence that the dodo bird (Raphus Cucullatus), extinct since 1681, could be alive is not quite as solid but still interesting. A night vision video recently uploaded to the Internet shows what appears to be a live dodo walking past an iguana.
The dodo bird became extinct because it was adapted to an ecosystem that had few predators. When humans began development on their island (Mauritius), the birds were rapidly dâ¦ecimated by hunting and by new predators (dogs, rats). In less than 80 years, their entire population was gone.
The last confirmed sighting of a dodo bird occurred in 1662 on the small island of Mauritus. Unconfirmed sightings persisted until the 1690s, but most experts agree the bird species was fully extinct by 1700. Continue Reading.
When did the dodo bird become extinct? It was actually in 1681. After being discovered, merely a centry  ago   The dodo bird was very easy to catch. Due to this fact people,  dogs, rats, even pigs, would huntâ¦ and kill the bird  indiscriminately and eat its eggs. this meant the only 200 years  after the bird was discovered, it became extinct.
During the 1800s, the United States gained much more land in the West and began to become industrialized. In 1861, several states in the South left the United States to start a new country called the Confederate States of America. This caused the American Civil War. After the war, Immigration from Europe resumed.

OWI operated from June 1942 until September 1945.
The history of the United States is what happened in the past in the United States, a country in North America. Native Americans have lived there for thousands of years, long before Europeans went there. Mainly English people went. In 1607, they went to Jamestown, Virginia.
The United States was recognized by Tripoli in 1796, but permanent diplomatic relations were not established until modern Libyaâs independence following World War II. From 1980 until 2006, the U.S. did not have an open Embassy in Libya, although relations were not formally severed.

Due to the needs for proper harvesting and curing tobacco, there is very little home or garden production of tobacco for personal use. Another deterrent to home production of tobacco is the need to age the cured tobacco for one to three years or longer.
Soil Nutrients. Nicotiana tabacum requires many essential elements in order for survival including: carbon, nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, manganese, boron, copper, zinc, and chlorine. The main flow of all these nutrients is from the roots, through the stem, and eventually to the leaves. The top of the plant which produces the flowers is the main destination for all of the nutrients. Carbon: Carbon makes up about 40 percent of the dry tobacco leaf right after it has been cured.
Growing Tobacco in the Home Garden1 By E.B. Whitty2. Many homeowners wish to grow a few plants of tobacco in their yard or garden for ornamental purposes or for personal use. Tobacco plants are usually no more difficult to grow than many other garden plants, but it is difficult to cure, age, and process tobacco without specialized facilities.
Nitrogen: Nitrogen is a very important element in the growth and quality of the tobacco leaf. Nitrogen has a major role in the content of nicotine, chlorophyll, and other important substances in the leaf that are essential for growth.
HARVESTING AND CURING. Due to the needs for proper harvesting and curing tobacco, there is very little home or garden production of tobacco for personal use. Another deterrent to home production of tobacco is the need to age the cured tobacco for one to three years or longer.
Soil pH should be about 5.8 for best growth of tobacco. If lime is needed to raise the pH, use dolomite in order to get the magnesium nutrient which is important for plant growth. Poor growth and some growth disorders may occur if the soil pH is about 6.5 or more.
Potassium: Tobacco requires a large amount of potassium to reach a healthy and mature plant. When potassium levels are not up to par the plant will develop cankers of dead tissue forming on the plant body, and the tips of the leaves will turn a brownish color.
By E.B. Whitty2. Many homeowners wish to grow a few plants of tobacco in their yard or garden for ornamental purposes or for personal use. Tobacco plants are usually no more difficult to grow than many other garden plants, but it is difficult to cure, age, and process tobacco without specialized facilities. For information on commercial production of tobacco, contact your local USDAâs Farm Service Agency office for marketing quota regulations.
A tobacco fertilizer should contain little or no chlorine and most of the nitrogen should be in the nitrate form. Fertilizer manufactured for use on tomato, pepper, and potato should be satisfactory for tobacco. Seed should be sown about 50-60 days prior to the desired date of transplanting.
Grasses would be excellent rotations for tobacco, while tomato, pepper, and similar plants would not be suitable. In addition to soil-borne pests, several virus diseases and insects that attack tomato and pepper also attack tobacco, so try to keep these plants in different areas of the garden.
The Asiatic lion used to live in West, South and Central regions of Asia and in Eastern Europe in historic times. Now the population of the lions currently exists in Western India's Gir Forest National Park. The type specimen of the Asiatic lion was first described from Persia in 1826, followed by descriptions of specimens from Hariana and Basra.
Panthera leo sinhaleyus. The Sri Lanka lion (Panthera leo sinhaleyus), also known as the Ceylon lion, was a prehistoric subspecies of lion, endemic to Sri Lanka. It appears to have become extinct prior to the arrival of culturally modern humans, c. 37,000 years BC. This lion is only known from two teeth found in deposits at Kuruwita.
Right: The 'massa' coin - without the Lion - used by the Kotte kingdom in southern Sri Lanka. And below: the 15th century 'massa' coin issued by Karava Prince Sapumal (Champaga Perumal - a Son of Karava General Manikka Thalevan, adopted by King Parakramabahu VI - see Mukkara Hatana) in Jaffna.
Many modern myths have been spun around the Lion flag which was adopted in 1950 as the National flag of Sri Lanka. The first myth is that Vijaya, the first King of Sri Lanka, arrived in Sri Lanka in 486 BCE, with a lion flag in his hand (see wikipedia etc.
The second myth is that all, or at least a majority, of the Sinhala speaking people in Sri Lanka are descendants of Vijaya and that their original ancestor was a Lion. FACT - According to history, there was no such Mega Sinhala race in Sri Lanka until the British period.
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is the full name of Sri Lanka. An island republic in the Indian Ocean, lying off the southeastern tip of the Indian subcontinent. The Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar separate Sri Lanka from India. The Arabian sea lies to the west, the Bay of Bengal to the northeast, and the Indian Ocean to the south. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is the full name of Sri Lanka.
Where does the president of Sri Lanka live? Former Presidents of Sri Lanka lived in the Janadhipathi Mandiraya  (President's House) in Colombo 1 but due to security reasons Mr. R.  Premadasa preferred Temple Trees resâ¦idence (Prime Minister's  House).
Myth #1. The first myth is that Vijaya, the first King of Sri Lanka, arrived in Sri Lanka in 486 BCE, with a lion flag in his hand (see wikipedia etc. ) and that since then the Lion symbol played a significant role in the history of Sri Lanka.
The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), also known as the Indian lion or Persian lion, is a lion subspecies that exists as a single population in India's Gujarat state. Some Asiatic lions also live in zoos. It is listed as Endangered by IUCN due to its small population size.
We didn't went to Lion Rock because we went to Pidurangala Rock (some recommendation). At the end, you only need to pay a donation of 3â¬ and the views are the some and with less people. I really recommend you not go to Lion Rock and going to Pidurangala Rock.

The Mal'ta-Buret' culture is an archaeological culture of the Upper Paleolithic (c. 24,000 to 15,000 BP) on the upper Angara River in the area west of Lake Baikal in the Irkutsk Oblast, Siberia, Russian Federation.esearch published in 2014 suggests that a Mal'ta like people were important genetic contributors to the American Indians, Europeans, and central and south Asians but did not contribute to and was not related to East Eurasians.

Mal'ta (sometimes spelled Malta and not to be confused with the Mediterranean island) is an Upper Paleolithic site in Siberia that has been found to include genetic evidence concerning the colonization of the Americas.he older child at Mal'ta has been direct-dated to 19,880 +/- 160 RCYBP, from well-preserved bone collagen. Isotopic analysis of the child's collagen indicate that his diet included about 25% freshwater aquatic foods, probably fish or waterfowl, and probably obtained from the nearby river.
Malta (/ËmÉltÉ/ ; [ËmÉltÉ]), officially the Republic of Malta (Maltese: Repubblika ta' Malta), is a Southern European island country comprising an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea.It lies 80 km (50 mi) south of Italy, 284 km (176 mi) east of Tunisia, and 333 km (207 mi) north of Libya.alta was awarded the George Cross by King George VI in 1942, for the country's bravery in the Second World War. The George Cross continues to appear on Malta's national flag.
Continue reading the main story. The genome of a young boy buried at Malâta near Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia some 24,000 years ago has turned out to hold two surprises for anthropologists.he first is that the boyâs DNA matches that of Western Europeans, showing that during the last Ice Age people from Europe had reached farther east across Eurasia than previously supposed. Though none of the Malâta boyâs skin or hair survives, his genes suggest he would have had brown hair, brown eyes and freckled skin.
Mongoloid features had been originally acknowledged in the skeletal remains of a child found at the site of Malta. Alexeev (1998, 323) in his later publication was more cautious, stating that this area wasâinhabited by a population of Mongoloid appearance.esearch published in 2014 suggests that a Mal'ta like people were important genetic contributors to the American Indians, Europeans, and central and south Asians but did not contribute to and was not related to East Eurasians.
Mal'ta is located on the left bank of the Belaya River in southeastern Siberia, near the modern town of Mal'ta which itself is near Irkutsk. Mal'ta's technological assemblage and date is similar to the nearby site of Buret', and together they make up the  Mal'ta Buret'  or Maltinsko-Buretskaya (in Russian) culture.he older child at Mal'ta has been direct-dated to 19,880 +/- 160 RCYBP, from well-preserved bone collagen. Isotopic analysis of the child's collagen indicate that his diet included about 25% freshwater aquatic foods, probably fish or waterfowl, and probably obtained from the nearby river.
Research published in 2014 indicates that the Mal'ta people belonged to a population, which may have made a substantial contribution to the genetic ancestry of the American Indians.esearch published in 2014 suggests that a Mal'ta like people were important genetic contributors to the American Indians, Europeans, and central and south Asians but did not contribute to and was not related to East Eurasians.
Malta has a long Christian legacy and its Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Malta is claimed to be an Apostolic See because, according to the Acts of the Apostles, Paul the Apostle was shipwrecked on Malta. Catholicism is the official religion in Malta.alta was awarded the George Cross by King George VI in 1942, for the country's bravery in the Second World War. The George Cross continues to appear on Malta's national flag.
The Malâta boy was 3 to 4 years old and was buried under a stone slab wearing an ivory diadem, a bead necklace and a bird-shaped pendant. Elsewhere at the same site about 30 Venus figurines were found of the kind produced by the Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe.he first is that the boyâs DNA matches that of Western Europeans, showing that during the last Ice Age people from Europe had reached farther east across Eurasia than previously supposed.

When you go somewhere, whether it's for fun or business, it's always nice to have an escort â someone to go along with you. Some escorts are there to protect you, some just to share a good time. The word escort can be a noun or a verb â your escort escorts you.. This word is derived from the Latin excorrigere, to set out, and moved through the Italian scorgere, meaning to guide.. In the 1570s it took on a military tone as escorte, used to describe armed protectors for travelers.

The Pulse Rate of a horse is different to a horseâs Heart Rate and can vary a lot, however it can be used as a good indication that your horse has a problem. The best and most reliable place to count a horseâs Pulse Rate is at the jaw, as it is the closest pulse point to the heart.Breathing (Respiration) Rate.f you know what is normal for your horse you will be able to see changes at an earlier stage rather than waiting until these vital signs have moved into the âextremely badâ range. You will need a watch with a âsecondsâ hand or better still a stopwatch. Heart Rate.
The average resting heart rate for a racehorse is around 28-32 beats per minute. A less fit horse might have a resting heart rate of around 30-40bpm.At maximum output, a ho â¦ rse's heart rate can reach 230-240bpm.At this rate, the heart will pump 250L/min.This is around 4-5 times the entire blood volume of the horse.he average heart rate for adults is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. If your heart rate is above or below that range â¦ then it may be a sign of a problem and you should see a doctor.
A resting adult horse should have a heartbeat range from 28 to 48 beats per minute. More than 60 beats per minute in an adult resting horse is abnormal and anything over 80 is really bad. Care should be taken as foals have a quicker heart rate of 70 to 90 beats per minute.Horses doing strenuous exercise can reach 200 beats per minute but this is rare and extreme.f you know what is normal for your horse you will be able to see changes at an earlier stage rather than waiting until these vital signs have moved into the âextremely badâ range. You will need a watch with a âsecondsâ hand or better still a stopwatch. Heart Rate.
A normal resting horse has a heart rate of 38-40 beats per minute, foals (70-120 bpm), yearlings (45-60 bpm) and 2 year olds (40-50 bpm). Maximum heart rates can exceed 180 beats per minute, but a rate above 80 should be considered serious in most non-exercising horses.he average respiration rate of a mature horse at rest is 8-15 breaths per minute. A horseâs respiration rate increases with hot or humid weather, exercise, fever or pain. Rapid breathing at rest should receive veterinary attention, and keep in mind that the respiration rate should NEVER exceed the pulse rate.
HORSE HEART RATE. An adult horse at rest will have a pulse rate ranging from 30 to 40 beats per minute. Foals will have a pulse rate ranging from 70 to 120, yearlings from 45 to 60 and two-year-olds from 40 to 50.If you are using a stethoscope, place it on the horse s girth area just behind the left elbow.he sounds you hear (if you have your speakers on) is the heart of a horse recovering after ten minutes of loping. His heart rate was about 150 beats per minute and down to approximatly 60 beats per minute at the end of the recording.
This measures the rate and strength of your horse's heartbeat. Normally, a resting horse has a pulse of 38 to 40 beats per minute. When exercising, a horse's maximum heart rate can exceed 180 beats per minute.However, in resting horses, a heart rate over 80 can be a sign of a serious problem.If a calm horse has a pulse that is consistently over 60, it can also be a problem.hen exercising, a horse's maximum heart rate can exceed 180 beats per minute. However, in resting horses, a heart rate over 80 can be a sign of a serious problem. If a calm horse has a pulse that is consistently over 60, it can also be a problem.

A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness.For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute.To measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. Place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe.or example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute.

For adults 18 and older, a normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the personâs physical condition and age. For children ages 6 to 15, the normal resting heart rate is between 70 and 100 bpm, according to the AHA.eart rate, also known as pulse, is the number of times a person's heart beats per minute. A normal heart rate depends on the individual, age, body size, heart conditions, whether the person is sitting or moving, medication use and even air temperature. Even emotions can have an impact on heart rate.

Liposuction performed with this solution is often called tumescent liposuction. In addition, liposuction is also characterized by the technology that disrupts fat. Traditional liposuction, often referred to as suction-assisted liposuction or SAL, involves removing fat with a cannula attached to a suction apparatus.
If you take a quick survey of the many liposuction/cosmetic surgery websites currently on the Internet, youâll find that the cost of liposuction can vary greatly across the US, but generally boils down to three primary factors:
Factors Determining the Cost of Liposuction. First of all, the type of market depends on the area you live. For example the price for liposuction in New York is more compared to that of Omaha. However, in areas that experience high labor expenses and high rent, you should be prepared to pay more for your liposuction.
For instance, the total amount of liposuction carried out on the buttocks, outer thighs and hips is determined by summing up say $2500 for hips, $3200 for outer thighs, $1900 for buttocks plus a surgical fee of $1700.
Costs of Liposuction. the cost of the operating facility/or hospital and supportive/nursing staff. Other costs routinely include pre-op lab fees (blood work or other tests), cost of the elastic compression garments youâll need, medications and prescriptions, and any specialized technology that may be used.
There 2 types of fat in the body. Only the Subcutaneous Fat is removed by the body. 1  Subcutaneous Fat: The fat that lies just under the skin; it acts as a buffer to support the skin and is an energy storage material.  Visceral Fat: This is the fat that is packed around the organs.
Liposuction in three areas of the body can range from $6000 to $8000, and in five areas, as high as $11,000. (Because most plastic surgeons offer âpackage dealsâ whereby a patient can have multiple areas treated while paying a flat fee for the operating facility and anesthesia, many choose this option.)
The cost of liposuction varies based on the extend of your surgery and the cost of any additional surgery. The average cost of liposuction is around $2000. Remember, the total cost depends on the number of areas needing liposuction. Everyone is different.
The best way to know the cost of your liposuction is to be evaluated during a consultation. To make liposuction affordable for you, we offer patient financing plans, so be sure to ask. Most health insurance plans will not cover liposuction, related complications or another surgery to revise the appearance of your body.
What Is Liposuction? Liposuction is defined as a surgical method that gets rid of fat that has accumulated on certain parts of the body. The fat is removed from body parts such as the neck, hips, buttocks, abdomen or arms using a suction technique to improve their body shape contours. Liposuction is also known as body contouring or lipoplasty. Liposuction cannot be largely considered as weight loss for the entire body or an alternative to losing weight.
Quick Answer. Standard computer monitor sizes include 17, 20 , 24 and 27 inches, as of 2015. Monitors are typically between 15 and 34 inches, but monitors between 17 and 30 inches are the most common sizes. Continue Reading.
Best Answer: People don`t buy average size monitors. They buy one based on what they want to use if for and price. For a school project a basic 17 -19 ins would do for a desktop. 15 ins for a latop.You don`t want to blow the school`s annual budget.
Your best bet is to get the biggest computer monitor that you can. There are a bunch of reasons why you should do this. If you have a MacBook, then the new 27-inch LED Apple Cinema Display is one of the most convenient monitors to have, thanks to its host of features that are geared towards MacBooks.
Standard computer wallpaper sizes are always changing because they are relative to the current popular monitor resolutions. Ideally, a computer's wallpaper will share the same resolution as the screen, which provides the best possible picture quality while using the least amount of computer resources possible.
The standard wallpaper sizes are determined by the most popular resolutions of the time. For example, most computer monitors ran the 1024x768 resolution for years until widescreen monitors grew in popularity, making 1366x768 the most popular resolution. A couple is measuring their wallpaper.
This display aspect ratio is the native resolution for many 24 widescreen LCD monitors, and is expected to also become a standard resolution for smaller to medium-size, wide-aspect tablet computers in the near future (as of 2012).
The 1920x1200 standard wallpaper size covers all the bases for screens running in a 16:10 aspect ratio. While 16:10 screens make up a large share of computer monitors, the devices are spread out between four different resolutions: 1920x1200, 1680x1050, 1440x900 and 1200x800.
What's the Best Computer Monitor Size? With a lot of people using their laptops as a desktop computer replacement, you'd think that smaller monitors might be better, but in all honesty, if you're looking for a new monitor, your best bet is to read on to find out what we think about computer monitor sizes.
The average size for a laptop is 15 inches but they range from 11 to 19 inches. The average size of the monitor for a desktop computer, on the other hand, is 23 inches I believe. You can find whatever size you desire. From 17 to 35 inches.
Computer display standards are a combination of aspect ratio, display size, display resolution, color depth, and refresh rate. They are associated with specific expansion cards, video connectors and monitors. 1 History.
1 37% - My taxact summary review is not showing any income and is showing refund $0 but when i submitted it was showing around $2500 whys that? 2  37% - Told refund is under review could take 11 weeks-will it really take that ling? 3  38% - Why is the georgia state refund check lasting so long in 2014?
Information you need to check the status of your refund: Social Security Number Filing status Exact refund amount In the news, the Internal Revenue Service has $760 million in unclaimed refunds it wants to give to the rightful owners.
1 Hire an accountant or tax services firm to follow up this issue on your behalf particularly if you have a tax obligation to the IRS. 2  But be warned, these are not the cheapest options and if you refund is less than $1,000 it may not be worth the cost.
}Â¡{blessed}i{. According to Georgia Department of Revenue website, their office issues most refunds within 30 business days. You may check the status of your refund on-line at Georgia Tax Center. You can start checking on the status of your return within 24 hours after they have received your e-filed return or 4 weeks after you mail a paper return. Before making an inquiry, please allow: 1  4 weeks for returns filed electronically. 2  6 weeks for paper returns filed prior to April 1st.
1 32% - Hi there how my georgia tax return was just accepted today how long is it taking to recieve a direct deposit from georgia now a days thanks? 2  33% - Why is it taking so long for the irs tax refund to show up in my emerald card it was final 2 2 weeks ago?
When it comes to tax season I receive a lot of reader questions, many tinged with a hint of desperation, around why IRS tax refunds are taking so long and what can be done to get refunds sooner rather than later. Here is a sampling of comments from the current and past tax seasons: Help me please.
1 Check the IRS tax tool, whereâs my refund, to get the official status of your refund (see estimated IRS refund schedule). 2  It is updated daily and provides the latest processing status of your tax refund. 3  The IRS has announced that it expects to issue more than 90% of refunds to taxpayers in less than 21 days.
The reason it is taking so long for some folks is due to the surge in identity theft. The IRS is taking longer to process/review returns which is yielding success in reducing identity theft but also has a side effect: delayed tax refunds for many legitimate filers.
0. 0. Georgia Department of Revenue usually sends refund within 21 business days from the date they receive it. You can check the status of your refund within 24 hours after they have received it if you filed it electronically or check the status after 4 weeks if you mailed your return.
It`s been over a month since Georgia received my taxes & I have called 5 times speaking to 5 different people & have been told 5 different stories! I was also told nothing is wrong with my information.
It is ve â¦ ry very important to maintain your homeostasis. If your body is not functioning properly to maintain the right body temperature you could die. Think about it, if your body doesn't do what it is supposed to do then your body temp can drop drastically if you are cold or raise if you are hot.

1 To explain the role of feedback mechanisms in homeostasis. 2  To distinguish negative feedback from positive feedback. 3  To identify and example of two organ systems working together to maintain homeostasis. 4  To summarize the role of the endocrine system in homeostasis.
Feedback Regulation Loops. The endocrine system plays an important role in homeostasis because hormones regulate the activity of body cells. The release of hormones into the blood is controlled by a stimulus. For example, the stimulus either causes an increase or a decrease in the amount of hormone secreted.
Disease as Failure of Homeostatic Mechanisms. Homeostasis is so important that, when it fails, it usually results in serious bodily damage. For example, the disease diabetes is a failure in the homeostasis of blood sugar. People with diabetes tend to have very high levels of sugar in their blood right after they eat and then very low levels in between meals.
It is an organismâs ability to keep a constant internal environment. Homeostasis is an important characteristic of living things. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside the cell. The adjusting of systems within a cell is called homeostatic regulation.

Instructor: Natalia Caporale. Homeostasis can be defined as a property of an organism or system that helps it maintain its parameters within a normal range of values. It is key to life, and failures in homeostasis can lead to diseases like hypertension and diabetes.
Making the world better, one answer at a time. Homeostasis is the conditions the organism needs to work at maximum efficiency. If an organism doesn't maintain homeostasis, the organism won't be able to operate at full capacity. Living things respond to stimuli that occur inside them. Their temperature also must be within a certain range.
PTH is the primary hormone that protects against hypocalcimia, so it is stimulated to secrete by low circulating [Ca++], which is sensed by the parathyroid chief cell through a CaSR (Ca++-sensing receptor, GPCR).
Choose the Right Type of Mint: 1  Spearmint and peppermint are the most popular types of mint. If you like chocolate, then mint chocolate may be the plant for you. 2  There around 3,500 varieties of mint, so there truly is a taste for every palette.
If you're going to grow mint in a container, I would chose a nice BIG and deep one and mix 'em up (spearmint, peppermint, orange mint, apple mint, chocolate mint, lime mint, the varieties are endless!). It's nice to have different types.
The peppermint herb is a leafy plant that doesnât grow more than 3 feet tall. Its leaves are fuzzy to the touch, and the plant gives off a faint peppery, sweet smell. Rubbing a peppermint leaf between fingers will release even more of the scent. Growing peppermint plants is incredibly easy.
In fact, mint is a plant that is very mild in the conditions it requires. Supply your mother mint plant with enough water: unlike other plants, mint needs a lot of water. You do not need to water it the whole day long; I do it only once a day or twice if necessary. Just make sure the soil is always humid. A dead mint plant probably hasn't received enough water or sunlight.
With light, sandy soil, the organic matter will help hold the water after rain or irrigation. If your soil has plenty of organic matter -- such as decayed leaves or compost -- worked into it, it will stay moist after a rain or irrigation. Organic matter acts like a sponge, holding moisture near the surface. That's good for onions, which have shallow roots and can't tap water or nutrients deep in the soil. If you're wondering about soil acidity or alkalinity (pH), onions do best if the soil pH is between 5.5 and 6.5, a little on the acid side.
That means that the peppermint plant does not spread through pollination. That doesnât mean the peppermint plant doesnât grow well on itâs own. On the contrary, peppermint plants, and all itâs kin, are fast growers. The peppermint plant has been used and cultivated since ancient times.
Here are the steps you need to follow in order to grow your own mint plant: 1  Buy yourself a mint plant. 2  Plant your mother plant in a larger pot. 3  Care for your mother plant: give it enough light and water.  Cut off a sprig and put it in a glass of 1  water. Wait, wait, wait.  Plant your new plant in a 1  pot. Drink  tea.
As mentioned, the peppermint herb is the cross between water mint and spearmint. So, that makes at least two more types of mint. Altogether, there are over 600 varieties of mint, with sixteen of them being used the most today. Some of these varieties mess with the smell of mint and make for some interesting scents.
How to Grow Mint Plants. Plant mint in full sun or part shade. It thrives in rich, moist, well-drained soil. Mint adapts to many soil types, but develops the best foliage in soil that has been enriched with a 2-inch-thick layer of compost. Frequent cutting keeps mint looking attractive.
Mint will grow in most soils - you've got yours in a pot, so you should use a potting mix - any will do. In a cooler climate it will take full sun. In a hot climate it does best in partial shade. Mints prefer moist soil with excellent drainage and the soil should never be allowed to dry out completely. Mint is susceptible to rust. Keep manure away and remove any yellow-streaked sprigs to prevent the spread of the rust virus.
Paranoid schizophrenia, schizophrenia, paranoid type is a sub-type of schizophrenia as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV code 295.30. It has been the most common type of schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia can have a devastating impact on patients and their families. Patients with schizophrenia have increased risk for self-destructive behaviors and suicide. The antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia can have severe side effects, including increased risk of obesity and diabetes.
Although paranoid schizophrenia is defined by those two symptoms, it is also defined by a lack of certain symptoms (negative symptoms). The following symptoms are not prominent: âdisorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, or flat or inappropriate affect..
About 60% of people with schizophrenia have no close relatives with the illness. Researchers are seeking the specific genetic factors that may be responsible for schizophrenia. Genes under investigation include the neuregulin-1 gene, the OLIG2 gene, and the COMT gene.
Most antipsychotic medications are approved only for adult patients. Some atypical antipsychotics (such as risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetapine) are approved for treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents (ages 13 - 17 years).
1 The patient may firmly believe something, even though there is incontrovertible evidence that it is false. En example may be a belief that a neighbor is plotting to kill or poison the patient.  Anxiety - a patient with paranoid schizophrenia will usually suffer from periods of high anxiety.
Common symptoms for paranoid schizophrenia include auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and paranoid delusions (believing everyone is out to cause the sufferer harm). However, two of the symptoms separate this form of schizophrenia from other forms.
Another criterion present in patients with paranoid schizophrenia is auditory hallucinations, in which the person hears voices or sounds that are not really present. The patient will sometimes hear multiple voices and the voices can either be talking to the patient or to one another.
Patients with paranoid schizophrenia are more likely to be affected by positive symptoms, such as delusions and auditory hallucinations, and less by problems with mood, cognition (thinking, concentration, attention), compared to other types of schizophrenia.
Paranoid Schizophrenia: Causes, Symptoms and Treatments. Paranoid schizophrenia is a subtype of schizophrenia in which the patient has delusions (false beliefs) that a person or some individuals are plotting against them or members of their family. Paranoid schizophrenia is the most common schizophrenia type.
This is the ratio of the adiabatic elasticity of air to the isothermal elasticity. Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 13, Slice 2 Various. But let us assume that we have a compressor which shows an adiabatic pressure line.
An adiabatic process is any process occurring without gain or loss of heat within a system. Assess the environments in which isothermal processes typically occur. Adiabatic processes can occur if the container of the system has thermally-insulated walls or the process happens in an extremely short time.
This sort of compression is called adiabatic. [Incidentally, this use of the term âadiabaticâ has nothing to do with an adiabatic process in quantum mechanics and, in fact, the meaning is almost the opposite.
Adiabatic cooling is used in evaporative coolers. An evaporative cooler is basically a large fan that draws warm air through water-moistened pads. As the water in the pads evaporates, the air is chilled and pushed out to the room. The temperature can be controlled by adjusting the airflow of the cooler.
1 For an adiabatically expanding ideal monatomic gas which does work on its environment (W is positive), internal energy of the gas should decrease.  In a sense, isothermal process can be considered as the opposite extreme of adiabatic process. In isothermal processes, heat exchange is slow enough so that the system's temperature remains constant.
Occurring without gain or loss of heat. When a gas is compressed under adiabatic conditions, its pressure increases and its temperature rises without the gain or loss of any heat. Conversely, when a gas expands under adiabatic conditions, its pressure and temperature both decrease without the gain or loss of heat. The adiabatic cooling of air as it rises in the atmosphere is the main cause of cloud formation.
The temperature falls at the adiabatic rate in unsaturated air till the base of the cumulus cloud is reached. Higher than this, the temperature decreases at a fairly uniform rate, but more slowly than the adiabatic rate. At the same time the utmost pains are taken to maintain the adiabatic condition of the metal walls.
Adiabatic cooling is the process of reducing heat through a change in air pressure caused by volume expansion. In data centers and other facilities, adiabatic processes have enabled free cooling methods, which use freely available natural phenomena to regulate temperature. The principle of adiabatic cooling has been harnessed to develop cooling units that can save industry millions of liters of water.
1 Adiabatic processes can occur if the container of the system has thermally-insulated walls or the process happens in an extremely short time.  For an adiabatically expanding ideal monatomic gas which does work on its environment (W is positive), internal energy of the gas should decrease.
In contrast, an adiabatic process is where a system exchanges no heat with its surroundings (Q = 0). (See our atom on Adiabatic Process. ) In other words, in an isothermal process, the value Î´T = 0 but Q â  0, while in an adiabatic process, Î´T â  0 but Q = 0.

Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, normally from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities.arbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction, so photosynthesis needs to supply both a source of energy to drive this process, and the electrons needed to convert carbon dioxide into a carbohydrate.
Photosynthesis is a two stage process. The first process is the Light Dependent Process (Light Reactions), requires the direct energy of light to make energy carrier molecules that are used in the second process.hotosynthesis is the process by which plants, some bacteria, and some protistans use the energy from sunlight to produce sugar, which cellular respiration converts into ATP, the fuel used by all living things.

Nuclear fusion research has been a mild success in terms of international cooperation, with a growing number of countries determined to contribute their own piece of the puzzle. Today, there are nuclear fusion experiments operating in the U.S., Germany, United Kingdom, India, France, Japan and several other countries.
Latin for âthe way,â ITER will be the largest and most powerful fusion generator in the world, and is expected to to cross the break-even point. ITER is projected to produce 500 MW of power with an input of 50 MW, and be able to hold plasma for half an hour or more.
WHAT IS FUSION? Fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars. It is the reaction in which two atoms of hydrogen combine together, or fuse, to form an atom of helium.
Fusion, at its core, is a simple concept. Take two hydrogen isotopes and smash them together with overwhelming force. The two atoms overcome their natural repulsion and fuse, yielding a reaction that produces an enormous amount of energy.
what is fusion? Fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars. It is the reaction in which two atoms of hydrogen combine together, or fuse, to form an atom of helium. In the process some of the mass of the hydrogen is converted into energy. The easiest fusion reaction to make happen is combining deuterium (or âheavy hydrogen) with tritium (or âheavy-heavy hydrogenâ) to make helium and a neutron. Deuterium is plentifully available in ordinary water. Tritium can be produced by combining the fusion neutron with the abundant light metal lithium.

Currently, the largest fusion reactor in the world is the Joint European Torus (JET), a tokamak based in England and supported by the European Union. JET was commissioned in the 1970s and first came online in 1983 and successfully produced plasma, the first step in achieving fusion.
Every fusion is energy consuming and part of the energy is bound in the created core. Cracking neutrons gives the energy back. The fusion is a energy consuming byproduct. It is a waste of the process, which is fission not fusion. Fusion reactors will never produce energy because they consume more energy! They are not real fusion reactors! Its fission!
While fusion is a nuclear process, the products of the fusion reaction (helium and a neutron) are not radioactive, and with proper design a fusion power plant would be passively safe, and would produce no long-lived radioactive waste.

1 Approximately 36,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the U.S. 2  Nearly 7,000 units of platelets and 10,000 units of plasma are needed daily in the U.S. 3  Nearly 21 million blood components are transfused each year in the U.S.  The average red blood cell transfusion is approximately 3 pints.
The 2015/16 price of red cells is detailed in the notes. Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for 70,000 hospital admissions per year and 11% of all red blood cell units transfused in England. It is the single leading clinical indication for transfusions for red blood cells. However there is no clear optimum threshold for the use of red blood cell transfusions.
The average adult has 8 â 12 pints of blood traveling all over his or her body through the heart, lungs, arteries, veins and capillaries. Blood is an essential part of our bodies that transports oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic waste. In addition to all that, blood performs these functions:
Blood is a living tissue composed of blood cells suspended in plasma. The cellular elements, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets â make up about 45% of the volume of whole blood. Plasma, which is 92% water, makes up the remaining 55%.
A reduction in red blood cell transfusion for AUIGIB would have substantial financial implications. In 2013-14, an estimated 204,000 units of red blood cells were issued for AUGIB, costing Â£123.31 per unit. A 13% reduction, as shown in this trial, would lead to annual savings to the NHS of about Â£3.3m for the blood alone, which excludes laboratory and administration costs.
1 The average adult has about 10 pints of blood in his body. Roughly 1 pint is given during a donation. 2  A healthy donor may donate red blood cells every 56 days, or double red cells every 112 days.  A healthy donor may donate platelets as few as 7 days apart, but a maximum of 24 times a year.
Whole blood units are usually around a pint or a bit over 450 mL Packed blood cells are usually around a half pint. According to the FAQ on the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center web site, a unit is one pint, which equals about 473 mL. Approximately 450mL according to Canadian Blood Services. This depends on various factors and the volume of blood in each unit bag will not always be the same from one bag to another.
A unit of whole blood is 450 milliliters, which is about 0.9510 U.S. pint. Forâ¦ components of blood, one unit is the amount of that substance that would normally be found in one unit of whole blood. The adult human body contains roughly 12 units of whole blood.   See the related link for more information.
If all blood donors gave two to four times a year, it would help prevent blood shortages. 17. You could donate 48 gallons of blood if you began at 17 years old and donate every 56 days until you reach 76 years old.
For components of blood, one unit is the amount of that substance that would normaâ¦lly be found in one unit of whole blood. The adult human body contains roughly 12 units of whole blood.0.45 litre = 1 unit of blood   Answer   According to Canadian Blood Services, a unit of blood is approximately 450 ml.

1 The test typically costs $5-$25. 2  For example, Bartell Drugs, a pharmacy with locations across Western Washington, offers a total cholesterol test for $5 and a complete lipid panel for $15. 3  Publix, with locations in South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida, offers cholesterol testing for $15-$20.
1 Walk-in clinics provide cholesterol testing for $50-$100 per visit. 2  The cost usually includes the cost of lab testing and the cost of an office visit. 3  For example, Minute Clinic, the medical clinic located inside many CVS Pharmacy locations, offers cholesterol testing for $59 plus a $30 lab fee.
1 CostHelper readers with insurance report out-of-pocket costs of $283 -$675 for blood tests, with an average of $432; total billed costs were $312 -$1,200 (averaging $755), with the insurance either paying or discounting the total cost by $29 -$525.
1 There are two basic types of home cholesterol tests -- the kind done completely in the privacy of one's home and the kind that requires shipment to a laboratory to complete. 2  At-home tests cost $15-$25; kits requiring shipment cost $25-$50.
1 If an insured patient receives a cholesterol test as part of a physical, there is typically a charge for an office visit copay. 2  Walk-in clinics provide cholesterol testing for $50-$100 per visit. 3  The cost usually includes the cost of lab testing and the cost of an office visit.
The charge for a lipid panel ranged from $10 to $10,169. Hospital prices for a basic metabolic panel (which doctors use to measure the body's metabolism) were $35 at one facility â and $7,303 at another.
1 For patients not covered by health insurance, total costs can be $100 -$3,000 or more, depending on the number and type of tests ordered; the cost of any doctor visits to order and interpret the tests; and whether the tests are done on an emergency basis.
1 The cost usually includes the cost of lab testing and the cost of an office visit. 2  For example, Minute Clinic, the medical clinic located inside many CVS Pharmacy locations, offers cholesterol testing for $59 plus a $30 lab fee.
1 The cost of cholesterol test depends on where the test will be performed. 2  The location of the clinic will be considered as a factor for the price difference of the test. 3  Another factor that can affect the price of cholesterol test is the type of test that will be taken.
If your total cholesterol is high, you have twice the risk for heart disease as a person with normal total cholesterol. Here is the adult range for HDL cholesterol: Normal: 35 to 65 mg/dL for men, 35 to 80 mg/dL for women. If your number is less than 25 mg/dL, your risk for coronary heart disease is doubled.

Automated Firearms Ballistics Technology. As with fingerprints, every firearm has unique characteristics. The barrel of a weapon leaves distinct markings on a projectile. The breech mechanism also leaves distinct markings on the cartridge case. These markings are produced by the breech face itself, the firing pin, extractor, and ejector.
The Integrated Ballistic Identification System (IBIS) provides a single system capable of comparing both types of ballistic evidence found at crime scenes. This integrated and automated imaging system permits a technician to enter and review large numbers of fired bullets and expended cartridge cases and cross reference hits made from each system for examination by a firearms examiner.
By doing automated searches, the system speeds up and optimizes time spent on comparisons. The best evidence in linking a firearm to a specific crime is matching the recovered projectile and cartridge casings to the suspect firearm. The IBIS consists of two separate work stations â a Data Acquisition Station and an Image Analysis Station. These stations operate in an independent manner. The Data Acquisition Station is used to collect image data.
Complex health management needs a highly coordinated team supported by sophisticated technology. Ibis â¢ delivers person-centered care through a dedicated care team that is informed and prompted by artificial intelligence.

Morocco's Jewish population dwindled from an approximate 250,000 to the current number of about 5,000. Between 1965 and 1972, the estimated number of registered Moroccans living in Europe increased tenfold, from 30,000 to 300,000, to around 400,000 by 1975 (see Table 1).
Since Spain's 1976 withdrawal from what is today called Western Sahara, Morocco has extended its de facto administrative control to roughly 80% of this territory; however, the UN does not recognize Morocco as the administering power for Western Sahara.
Also, as most books in Morocco as written in French, and seldom translated into English, it is often difficult for non- French speaking westerners to find literature from or about Morocco. In addition to Arabic, Berber and French, it is also common to hear Spanish, German and most recently English in certain areas of Morocco. Until 1965, the Spanish controlled northern Moroccan cities such as Tetouan. Also, because northern Morocco is in such close proximity to Spain, Spanish is commonly spoken in Tangier.

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: Urethral stent placement is a procedure to open a blockage or stricture (narrowing) in your urethra with a stent. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body. A stent is a small plastic or metal tube that is used to open your narrowed urethra. Blockages and strictures can make it hard for urine to flow out of your body. Pelvic (hip) injuries and repeat urinary tract infections may lead to urethral strictures and blockages.
A catheter (thin tube) with a balloon attached may be placed over the wire. The balloon on the catheter will be inflated to widen your narrowed urethra. The stent will be put into your urethra, over the wire, to the area of the blockage. Once the stent is in place, the wire and catheter will be removed. An x-ray may be done to check if the stent is in the proper place inside your urethra.
A âureteral stentâ or âureteric stentâ is a thin, hollow tube inserted into the ureter. Ureters are thin tube-like-organs which connect kidneys to the urinary bladder, to allow urine flow from the kidney. The stent is longer than the actual ureter and tube-ends are usually coiled.
What is it? A thin, hollow tube placed inside the ureter during surgery to ensure drainage of urine from the kidney into the bladder. J shaped curls are present at both ends to hold the tube in place and prevent migration, hence the description double J stent. It allows the kidney to drain urine by temporarily relieving any obstruction, or to assist the kidney in passing out stone fragments into the bladder after definitive kidney stone treatment.
This topic will discuss the indications for ureteral stenting, technique of ureteral stent placement, management of stents, and stent complications. The management of urinary obstruction and urinary tract infection are discussed in detail elsewhere. Ureteral stents are functionally used to re-establish or maintain the patency of the ureter.
Urethral stent placement is a procedure to open a blockage or stricture (narrowing) of your urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body. A stent is a small plastic or metal tube used to open your narrowed urethra.
Patients with complicated obstruction need prompt decompression of the urinary tract with either placement of an indwelling ureteral stent or a percutaneous nephrostomy tube [7-9]. Retrograde ureteral stent placement and percutaneous nephrostomy both effectively relieve obstruction and infection due to ureteral calculi.
A ureteric stent is a fine plastic tube inserted into your kidney. It allows urine to drain from your kidney into your bladder when you have a blockage - a stone or growth - in your ureter (a narrow, muscular tube that connects your kidney to your bladder).
It can be blocked within ureter. Blockage such as a stone can hinder the urine flow from kidneys to bladder. Some disease process such as infection, scar or tumour in the wall of ureter can obstruct the lumen of ureter. In other cases, any mass or swelling in side abdomen/pelvis can compress the ureter from outside.
â¢ The stent may irritate your bladder causing you to feel a need to pass urine frequently. â¢ You may see blood in your urine on some occasions. Sometimes you may feel pain in your back (on the side of your body where the stent is) when passing urine. This is usual as the stent may rub against the wall of your ureter.

What we donât know is what Pangaeaâs original configuration looked like as the Plate Tectonicsâ version is incorrect. To resolve this a new Pangaea model was created by precisely reversing the Earthâs ocean basin growth patterns as dictated by data shown on the Age of Oceanic Lithosphere map above.
About 200 million years ago, the supercontinent began to break up. Gondwana (what is now Africa, South America, Antarctica, India and Australia) first split from Laurasia (Eurasia and North America). Then about 150 million years ago, Gondwana broke up.
German climatologist and geophysicist who, in 1915, published as expanded version of his 1912 book The Origin of Continents and Oceans. This work was one of the first to suggest continental drift and plate tectonics. He suggested that a supercontinent he called Pangaea had existed in the past, broke up starting 200 million years ago, and that the pieces drifted to their present positions.
Plate Tectonics is the latest theory of how our planet came to be. This modern day theory is also incorrect. New objective research dating the Earthâs ocean basin formation and growth patterns (shown below) does not support Plate Tectonicsâ version of Pangaea and its separation.
The New Pangaea Theory Part One. 252 million years ago our planet was impacted by a massive comet, a comet far larger than the one that wiped out the dinosaurs. This previous impact was so powerful it fractured the Earthâs crust, began the breakup of Pangaea and wiped out most of the life on the planet.
The explanation for Pangaea's formation ushered in the modern theory of plate tectonics, which posits that the Earth's outer shell is broken up into several plates that slide over Earth's rocky shell, the mantle.
The New Pangaea Theory Part One. Introduction to the New Pangaea Theory. The scientific history concerning our planet is fraught with well-intentioned but incorrect ideas that were believed by both the lay persons and the experts of their time.
Pangaea formed through a gradual process spanning a few hundred million years. Beginning about 480 million years ago, a continent called Laurentia, which includes parts of North America, merged with several other micro-continents to form Euramerica.
Facts About Pangaea, Ancient Supercontinent. The breakup of the Pangaea supercontinent. About 300 million years ago, Earth didn't have seven continents, but instead one massive supercontinent called Pangaea, which was surrounded by a single ocean called Panthalassa.
As he read, his earlier conjecture that the continents had once been joined became a conviction he would boldly champion for the rest of his life. Just a few months later, on January 6, 1912, Wegener startled a meeting of the Geological Association in Frankfurt with his radical theory.
Meaning: Something said when a person is at a loss for words. History: There are two possible sources for this common saying. The first refers to the cat-oâ-nine-tails â a whip used by the English Navy for flogging. The whip caused so much pain that the victims were left speechless.
Meaning: Hang on to valuable things when getting rid of unnecessary things. Hisory: During the 1500s, most people bathed once a year. Even when they did bathe, the entire family used the same tubful of water. The man of the house bathed first, followed by other males, then females, and finally the babies.
This isn't the origin, but it certainly popularized the phrase: Atom Ant is the smallest but mightiest defender of law and order. Headquartered in his secret lab beneath an ant hill, his cry of 'Up and at 'em, Atom Ant' sends evil-doers scrambling for cover! Comedian Howard Morris provided the voice for Atom.
I think that you mean Up and at 'em. I believe this saying came from the great war of 1914, when the troops came up out of the trenches to advance on the enemy. The cry Up and at 'em boys would have given the troops encouragement.
First, we know that Cain killed Abel when Adam was nearly one hundred and thirty years old. Support from this comes from the fact that Seth is born specifically to replace Abel, and that birth occurs when Adam was one hundred and thirty (Gen. 5:3).
No actually that is what is mistaken for the phrase Up and at 'em. 3 people found this useful.
Second, it appears that Abel and Cain were born soon after Adam's expulsion from the garden (Gen. 3:24; 4:1). So between the birth of the first two and the birth of Seth, we have over a hundred year time span. Surely that's plenty of time to party reproductively.
: Your phrase suggests combat. It may be derived from Up, Guards, and at 'em!, about which Eric Partridge says the following in A Dictionary of Catch Phrases American and British: : A catchphrase of light-hearted or, at the least, nonchalant defiance . . . : late C19-20.
Where did the human races come from? According to the Bible, all humans on Earth today are descended from Noah and his wife, his three sons and their wives, and before that from Adam and Eve (Genesis 1-11). But today we have many different groups, often called âraces,â with what seem to be greatly differing features.
What is the origin of the phrase to get your Irish up?   There is a belief that the Irish people are renowned for their (bad) temper. People therefore sometimes refer to the Irish Temper. So, Don't get your Irish up. meansâ¦ Don't lose your temper.

The reoxygenated blood then flows to the left side of the heart, and is pumped out again to all the systems and organs of the body. This major circulatory system is called the systemic circulation. The circulation of blood through the fetus bypasses the pulmonary circuit (see also fetal circulation).
The term dressing refers to the material that is placed directly over the wound. The dressing absorbs some of the blood and helps a clot to form. The clot plugs the wound to stop the bleeding. The dressing also protects the wound from additional contamination and injury.
The heart. and the blood vessels are the most important parts of the circulatory system. The heart is a central. organ in the circulatory system. With each beat it forces blood into the blood vessels which. transport or carry oxygen and nutrients to all of the tissues and organs (the arteries) of the body and.
Thrombosis and blood clots. One of the more extreme circulation problems is called thrombosis. Lack of movement in certain areas can result in blood clots which can become serious. Blood clots are also known as thrombosis, from the Greek word from âthrombosâ meaning a clot. Exercise helps the circulation flowing and speeds it up.
If blood continues to seep from the dressing after you have secured the dressing, applied manual pressure, and elevated the wound (if applicable), you should apply a pressure dressing. The objective of applying a pressure dressing is to stop the bleeding, not to stop all blood circulation below the wound.
In normal circulation, the oxygenated blood leaves the left side of the heart through very large. arteries. It flows through smaller and smaller and even smaller arteries arterioles and capillaries. until it reaches the tissues and organs where the blood vessels are very small usually requiring a. microscope to see them.
They stick to the walls in the area and each other, changing shape to form a plug that fills in the broken part to stop blood from leaking out. When activated, platelets also release chemicals to attract more platelets and other cells, and to set off the next step. 2. The clot grows.
Arterial System. Blood pumped from the left side of the heart enters the aorta, the main arterial trunk of the systemic circulation. The aorta, which is about 1 inch in diameter, arches upward and toward the left side of the body. Just above the heart two coronary arteries branch off from the aorta.
Blood clots are healthy and lifesaving when they stop bleeding. But they can also form when they aren't needed and cause a heart attack, stroke, or other serious medical problems. The life cycle of a normal blood clot depends on a series of chemical interactions. 1. Platelets form a plug.
If the pressure dressing controls the bleeding, proceed to check the casualty for other injuries. Recheck the circulation below the pressure dressing periodically and monitor the casualty for shock (Lesson 8). If the wound continues to bleed, apply a tourniquet as described in the following paragraphs. 4-7.
Safeopedia explains Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) Noise Reduction Rating is used to evaluate and determine the effictiveness or fit of noise protection equipment for a given work environment. NRR is specifically the measurement, in decibles, of how well hearing protection reduces noise as specified by the Environmental Protection Agency.
NRR STANDS FOR NOISE REDUCTION RATING. NRR (noise reduction rating) is a single number rating method which describes a hearing protection device (HPD) based on how much the overall noise level is reduced by the HPD. Most noise measurements in the industry are derived from the A-weighting scale.
One type of earplugs, for protection against water, dust etc. An earplug is a device that is meant to be inserted in the ear canal to protect the user's ears from loud noises or the intrusion of water, foreign bodies, dust or excessive wind. 1 Protection from water.
Learn about the importance of Noise Reduction Ratings (NRR) in Hearing Protection. Workers have been using hearing protection devices (HPD) since the 1960's to protect themselves from high levels of noise. Approximately 30 million workers in the United States are occupationally exposed to hazardous noises each year.
What do these rating numbers mean? Howard LeightÂ® hearing protectors are packaged to be shipped throughout the world. While customers in the U.S. are familiar with the NRR labeling required by the EPA, they may be a bit confused with packaging that includes other rating numbers.
Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) is the difference between the overall C-weighted sound level of a noise spectrum having equal energy per octave and the resulting A-weighted noise levels under a hearing protection device.
Noise Reduction Rating â NRR. Hearing loss affects nearly one in ten Americans. This condition is usually caused by exposure to excessive noise. Shooting firearms is one of the activities that expose individuals to excessive noise. The noise levels that are produced when firearms are used can lead to permanent hearing loss. This makes it necessary to use hearing protection with good noise reduction rating.
This means that if you are firing a rifle that produces 140 dB and the hearing protection that you have on has an NRR 33 dB, the level of noise exposure is not reduced to 103 dB. To determine how much noise exposure is reduce, deduct 7 from the NRR on the device and divide the result by two.
The following summary explains the rating numbers seen on Howard LeightÂ® packaging: NRR [Noise Reduction Rating] â This rating is used in the United States, and is accepted for use in a variety of other countries. The current range of NRRs available in the U.S. market extends from 0 to 33 decibels.
This is the question most frequently asked when a distributor or end user is looking for technical information on hearing protectors. NRR: The NRR (noise reduction rating) is a method which attempts to describe a hearing protector based on how much the overall noise level is reduced by the hearing protector.

Psychology definition for Anchoring Heuristic in normal everyday language, edited by psychologists, professors and leading students. Help us get better.
Anchoring Heuristic. The Anchoring Heuristic, also know as focalism, refers to the human tendency to accept and rely on, the first piece of information received before making a decision. That first piece of information is the anchor and sets the tone for everything that follows.
A heuristic technique, often called simply a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals. Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution. Heuristics can be mental shortcuts that ease the cognitive load of making a decision. Examples of this method include
The study of heuristics in human decision-making was developed in the 1970s and 80s by Israeli psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, although the concept was originally introduced by Nobel laureate Herbert A. Simon.
(Redirected from Hueristic) A heuristic technique (/hjuËËrÉªstÉªk/; Ancient Greek: Îµá½ÏÎ¯ÏÎºÏ, find or discover), often called simply a heuristic, is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals.

3 Examples of The Anchoring Rule in Marketing. In 1974 cognitive psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky identified what is known as the âanchoring heuristic.â A heuristic is essentially a mental shortcut or rule of thumb the brain uses to simplify complex problems in order to make decisions (also known as a cognitive bias). The anchoring rule of thumb describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the âanchorâ) when making decisions. Once the anchor is set, decisions are then made by adjusting around the initial anchor number, regardless of the legitimacy of the actual anchor number.
Gerd Gigerenzer focused on the fast and frugal properties of heuristics, i.e., using heuristics in a way that is principally accurate and thus eliminating most cognitive bias. Heuristics â like the recognition heuristic or the take-the-best heuristic â are viewed as special tools that tackle specific tasks (e.g., binary choice) under conditions of uncertainty and are organized in an adaptive toolbox.
Anchoring Heuristic The Anchoring Heuristic, also know as focalism, refers to the human tendency to accept and rely on, the first piece of information received before making a decision. That first piece of information is the anchor and sets the tone for everything that follows. For example, a car dealer might suggest a price for a car and the customer will try to negotiate down from that price, even if the price suggested is more than the Blue Book Value.
Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the anchor) when making decisions. During decision making, anchoring occurs when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments. Once an anchor is set, other judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor.

Scottish Banknotes. Although the pound sterling is the official currency of Scotland, three of the Scottish retail banks - - Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale Bank â - issue their own banknotes. Bank of England notes are also frequently used. This means that a visitor to Scotland is faced with what initially at least may seem like a bewildering variety of notes: four in each of the common denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 pounds.
Thus you should insist on being billed in Pounds Sterling or Euros when purchasing goods, not in Dollars (when the trader uses his own exchange rate). Credit card skimming is on the decline, but still a risk. In Northern Ireland, only credit cards using the  chip and PIN  system are accepted in shops.
Northern Ireland-Pounds and Pennies. One Pound Sterling (Â£) has 100 Pence (p) and coins are available in denominations of 1 p, 2 p (all copper), 5 p, 10 p, 20 p, 50 p (all silver), Â£ 1 (golden) and Â£ 2 (silver with gold). 50 c and Â£ 1 coins can have commemorative or local designs on the reverse.
It is also one with the greatest number of devolved functions, has its own parliament, legal and education systems. The official currency in Scotland is, however, the same as in the whole of the U.K.: the British pound sterling, consisting of 100 pence.
While cash is the most immediate form of payment and accepted everywhere (in fact preferred in a number of cases), credit cards and traveller's checks can be an alternative. But there are pitfalls.
The exchange rate of the pound sterling to the U.S. dollar varies, but between 2009 and 2013, the official exchange rate stayed somewhere in the region of 60-to-70 pence per U.S. dollar.

UK banks will accept them but foreign banks generally do not.

Staghorn Fern Care: How To Water, Grow and Care for Mounted Staghorn Ferns January 27 2015 152 Comments. Itâs a fact: staghorn ferns are stunning. Mounted on a board, wrapped in vintage burlap, and hung a wall, these plants are truly works of living art.
Here are a few pointers about their care: 1  Most ferns like an evenly moist soil with regular waterings. 2  Bushy ferns can be difficult to water. 3  Bathrooms and kitchens are good environments for ferns because of all the running water.  Help maintain moisture levels by using double containers for your ferns.
Tip: It's actually a good idea to repot a large fern, especially if it is pot bound, unless you want to water all the time. The correct soil mix is essential to the health of the plant, too. To make a potting mixture suitable for Boston ferns, combine equal parts of peat moss, sand, and garden soil.
Most ferns like an evenly moist soil with regular waterings. Allowing the soil to dry out between waterings stresses these plants. Bushy ferns can be difficult to water. Try using a watering can with a long spout to direct the water to the center of the plant. Water generously, until it drains out of the bottom of the pot. Bathrooms and kitchens are good environments for ferns because of all the running water.
What it needs: Place it in bright, indirect light or partial shade and well-drained soil. Feed once a month with a water-soluble fertilizer such as 20-20-20. Key to success: Display âTigerâ fern in a location where it wonât get too hot, such as in the cool shade of a deep porch. Good drainage is critical as well.
A good rule of thumb is to water once per week in dry, hot times of year, and once every two to three weeks during cooler months. Start with this schedule, and adjust as necessary depending on your space. Staghorn ferns absorb water through their fronds, as well as their roots.
During the hot months of summer, an indoor Boston fern on a table or stand can be placed on a saucer filled with stones and water. As the water evaporates, humidity is naturally provided to the plant. Simply fill a plant saucer with gravel, and then add water, stopping just below the top of the gravel.
Although the fern isnât difficult to grow, it tends to shed its leaves if it doesnât receive plenty of bright light. Watering a Boston fern isnât rocket science, but understanding how much and how often to water Boston ferns requires a bit of practice and careful attention. Too much or too little water are both detrimental to the plant. Letâs learn more about Boston fern irrigation.
Watering and Feeding. In warmer months during the growing season, provide your Boston fern with enough tepid water to keep the soil evenly moist, but not saturated. Water it more frequently during the hottest months of summer, and try not to let the soil become dry before watering.
Water only when soil is just dry to the touch. 1  If leaves turn yellow and soil is wet 1 to 2 inches beneath the surface, you are watering too much. 2  Ferns love humidity and appreciate an occasional misting. 3  Never fertilize a fernâor any plantâthat is too dry; it can burn the roots.
A: A high absolute neutrophil count may indicate inflammation, infection, stress, reaction to medication or the presence of cancer, according to HealthTap contributor Dr. Reid Blackwelder. In most instances, levels above 8,000 per cubic millimeter are considered abnormally high, though this varies on the age and health of the patient.
Monocytes: 2% to 8%. Eosinophils: 1% to 4%. Basophils: 0.5% to 1%. Band: 0% to 3%. Elevated Total leukocytic count can occur in different condition like infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), systemic disease (e.g.inflamtory bowel diseases and vasculitis), physical stress, cancer especially hematologic malignancies.
Transient elevation of the white blood cells is not warning but should be properly approached. Serial CBC follow up is essential. On the other hand, persistent elevation in the white blood cell count should be investigated properly to exclude both chronic systemic inflammatory conditions and malignancy.
What are some facts about high neutrophil blood count? A: A high neutrophil blood count can mean the patient has an infection or is suffering from great stress, according to MedlinePlus. Other interpretations of a...
The most common of the white blood cells, neutrophils account for 50 to 70 percent of the leukocytes and are one of the first immune cells to arrive at the site of inflamed or injured areas. Arthritis, rheumatic fever, thyroiditis, acute kidney failure and eclampsia are listed as additional causes of high neutrophil counts by Med-Health.
I have recently changed dr's looking for someone not so eager to pass out pills for anxiety. My dr. looked at some old blood tests I took to him and ordered a repeat. My CBC came back with high WBC of 14.1, high neutrophils of 9.6 and high leukocytes of 3.57. The issue is I looked at some of my lab results since 2005 and everyone I seen shown a combination of 2 or 3 of these high on them all.

Quick Answer. A high absolute neutrophil count may indicate inflammation, infection, stress, reaction to medication or the presence of cancer, according to HealthTap contributor Dr. Reid Blackwelder. In most instances, levels above 8,000 per cubic millimeter are considered abnormally high, though this varies on the age and health of the patient.
High white blood count could be caused by an infection, inflammation, allergies, asthma, leukemia, severe stress, or tissue death. High absolute neutrophilis could be caused by an acute bacterial infection, inflammation, stress, inflammation, and certain leukemia's. High red cell distribution width could be caused by mixed rbc's. High white blood count could be caused by an infection, inflammation, allergies, asthma, leukemia, severe stress, or tissue death.
Smoking is well documented to increase the white cell count especially neutrophils. Although a higher than 11,000 white cells/mcl of blood is considered high, in leukemias the white blood cell counts can reach 100,000. An elevated ESR, LDH or CRP would be helpful and would make inflammatory changes more likely although not conclusive.
He didn't ejaculate and he hadn't within the previous two days. Now, I am two days late and I am feeling bloated, and irritable, no other symptoms really. Usually, I vary a couple of days from when I think my period will come, but for some reason I tend to freak out when I any days late from the previous month.
Seasonique is an extended regimen pill that offers the convenience of only 4 periods a year. A woman's body is used to having 13 periods a year but when you are on the pill you can skip your period b/c it is only withdrawal bleeding caused by removing the hormones and taking a placebo pill(usually for 7 days).
Seasonique and LoSeasonique work just like any traditional birth control pill. The biggest difference is that these are extended cycle pills, so each pill packs come with a 3 month supply of pills. You take one pill every day for 3 months.
My period is going on four days late. My last period was on 8/8/08 my periods are pretty normal. I took two pregnancy test and they came out negative, I'm really worried that I could be pregnant. I had cramps and breast sourness all last week and now its gone.
Women typically begin getting their periods anywhere from age 10 to 15. During the first two years after starting your period, your hormones may still be adjusting. This can cause late or missed periods. Menopause generally begins between ages 45 to 55. As your body goes through the transition, your normal cycle can become irregular.
27 out of 28 found this helpful. In both of my pregnancies, I took tests 1 - 2 days after my missed periods which both turned out negative. I waited about 3 more days both times and then each turned out positive. I guess it just depends on your hormones... by now, you should be fine trying another test. When in doubt, see your doctor.
I am on my 2nd week of Seasonique--and began it because I had some terrible PMS symptoms for the past 3 months. I also get migraines, and in that 3 month period, I was getting tons of migraines during the 14 day (or so) time frame before my period was due to start.
have Missed my period for 2 weeks, i feel nauseated in the morning , i have pain at my lower back ,also i have new pain under my abdomen , i had slight spotting before i Missed my period ,i start to urinate alot lately , i feel lazy alot . i made home test at Saturday and it was negative . now my period late 2 weeks ..
I've been on Seasonique for 6 weeks and after the first 25 days, my period started (within three days of when it normally would have) and it hasn't stopped, but the bleeding became very, very light after 5 days of the normal heavy bleeding, but cramping was much, much less than what I normally experienced.
Most women usually have a period every 28 days between starting their period and menopause. However, a healthy menstrual cycle can range from every 21 to 35 days. If your period doesnât fall within these ranges, it could be because of one of these reasons.
If the faucet still leaks after tightening the packing nut, the washer on the end of the valve stem needs to be replaced. 1  Turn the water off at the water meter using a cut-off key. 2  Unscrew the packing nut beneath the handle of the faucet.  Grasp the faucet handle, and pull the valve stem out of the hose bibb.
Leaks in outdoor faucets usually occur in two places â the handle and the spout. Handle - Try tightening the packing nut with a wrench. If that fails to stop the leak, youâll have to remove the faucetâs valve stem assembly. See steps below.
1 If that fails, replace the packing. 2  If the faucet leaks from the spout, either a washer is defective or a valve seat is badly corroded.  To find out which side needs work, turn off the shutoff valves one at a time; the leak will stop when one or the other is turned off.
Leaking Compression Faucets. If your faucet has separate hot and cold water handles, it's probably a compression faucet (also called a stem or washer faucet). In this faucet, a rubber seat washer is secured to the stem, which has very coarse threads on the outside.
When you turn the handle to shut off the faucet, the stem is screwed down, compressing the washer against the valve seat in the faucet body. The stem is secured by a packing nut, which compresses the packing (twine, a washer, or an O-ring) and prevents water from leaking around the stem. 1  If water leaks around the handle, tighten the packing nut.  If the faucet leaks from the spout, either a washer is defective or a valve seat is badly corroded.

The cause of uncontrolled cell growth in the pituitary gland, which creates a tumor, remains unknown. The pituitary gland is a small, bean-shaped gland situated at the base of your brain, somewhat behind your nose and between your ears. Despite its small size, the gland influences nearly every part of your body.
This depends on the type of tumor and the size of the tumor. A large tumor may cause loss of vision, particularly peripheral vision, if it compresses the optic chiasm (where the optic [eye] nerves come together, located above the pituitary gland).
Surgery for Pituitary Tumors. Pituitary tumor surgery involves removing all or most of the tumor that's growing on your pituitary gland. But what type of surgery you have depends on the type of pituitary tumor you have, as well as the tumor's size and shape. Surgery is typically needed for 2 reasons: If the tumor is pressing on your optic nerves, which can potentially lead to blindness.
Large pituitary tumors â those measuring about 1 centimeter (slightly less than a half-inch) or larger â are known as macroadenomas. Smaller tumors are called microadenomas. Because of the size of macroadenomas, they can put pressure on the normal pituitary gland and nearby structures.
Surgery is the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. It is the most common treatment for a pituitary gland tumor. Surgery, which is performed by a surgical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating a tumor using surgery, is often successful in removing the entire tumor. About 95% of surgeries to remove pituitary gland tumors are done by the transsphenoidal route.
If a pituitary tumor is overproducing a hormone, there are medications that can help. The drugs bromocriptine (Parlodel) and cabergoline (Dostinex) are used to treat tumors that secrete prolactin. Octreotide (Sandostatin) or pegvisomant (Somavert) can be used to treat tumors that make growth hormone.
Pituitary Tumor. Pituitary Tumor: Endoscopic Procedure Revolutionizes Pituitary Surgery. One of the most extraordinary advances pioneered at the Skull Base Institute is the minimally invasive, fully endoscopic approach to treating pituitary tumors (pituitary adenomas) and other skull base disorders.
Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Pituitary tumors that make hormones (functioning) can cause a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the hormone they produce. The signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors that don't make hormones (nonfunctioning) are related to their growth and the pressure they put on other structures.
The pituitary gland is NOT in the brain and pituitary tissue is different from brain tissue. Since the pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and is connected to the brain by a thin stalk, there is often confusion, particularly by insurance companies, about the classification of a pituitary tumor.
Complete removal of a tumor is the desired goal. However, a minority of patients with pituitary tumor will have a recurrence of the tumor. Approximately 16% of patients with a non functioning tumor will have a tumor recurrence within 10 years and 10% require additional treatment (surgery, pituitary radiation).
All vehicles registered in the UK must have a unique, stamped-in vehicle identification number (.
A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a set of unique digits that relate to specific information about your vehicle (1981 or newer).
The 4th to 8th positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the automobile platform used, the model, and the body style.
You can locate and decode your vehicle's identification number (VIN) in a variety of places. 1  On the dashboard, just below the windshield (driver's side).
VIN is recorded in Vehicle License of China. A vehicle identification number, commonly abbreviated to VIN, or chassis number, is a unique code including a serial number, used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters and mopeds as defined in ISO 3833. VINs were first used in 1954.
The 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS). This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number.
Instructions. Find the VIN number on the Certificate of Title. The VIN number is generally located in the upper left hand corner of the Certificate of Title and is labeled as the vehicle identification number. Check your vehicle's proof of registration.
Each car and truck built after 1980 has been stamped by the manufacturer with a unique vehicle identification number or VIN. The VIN is unique to the vehicle the way your fingerprint is unique to you, and it's how we are able to deliver critical vehicle specific data in the AutoCheck Â® vehicle history report.

An encounter between at least one of humanity's ancestors and a saber-toothed tiger has been preserved for the ages, according to German researchers. And that meeting bears every indication of what one might expect -- violence.
Smilodon is a sit-and-wait predator and it only pounces when its prey is close enough. The structure of the bones tells us that saber tooth cat could roar in the same way as present day cats do. They used to fight over mates. The upper canines of the saber tooth tiger are 30 cm (12 inches).
The giants of the ice age such as elephant-sized sloths and sabre-toothed tigers were pushed into extinction within 100 years by a double whammy of warming and hunting by man. They once roamed the windswept plains of Patagonia in the southern tip of South America along with humans.
And, in this case, they look to have come in handy. Archaeologists found saber-tooth bones alongside the spears and stone tools at the ancient embankment. The find is an early indication that earliest humans were using weapons against animals of prey. And it suggests they had violent clashes with the great cat -- an animal believed to have died off some 12,000 years ago.
Species such as the South American horse, giant jaguar and sabre-toothed cat, and the enormous one-tonne short-faced bear (the largest land-based mammalian carnivore) were found widely across Patagonia, but seemed to disappear shortly after humans arrived.

Reason behind sabre toothed tiger ice age extinction revealed The tigers roamed the windswept plains of Patagonia in the southern tip of South America before their extinction 12,000 years ago Share
Full Answer. Perhaps the most well known saber-toothed cat is the Smilodon, often referred to as the saber-toothed tiger. Smilodon's territory extended across North and South America, although they are often associated with the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where thousands of intact remains have been found.
It is highly likely that humans were confronted by saber-toothed cats at the SchÃ¶ningen lakeside, a University of TÃ¼bingen press release reads. In that case, all the human could do was grab his up to 2.3 metres long spear and defend himself..
This overlap may be partially to blame for the saber-toothed cats' disappearance. Early humans may have hunted the saber-toothed cats' primary prey to the point of extinction. It is also likely that the saber-toothed cats were hunted themselves as they continued to encounter growing populations of early humans.
Saber-Toothed Tigers And Humans Met About 300,000 Years Ago At SchÃ¶ningen In Present-Day Germany. Walk With Beasts exhibition, Horniman Museum, London. The Smilodon is also colloquially known as Saber-toothed cat or Saber-toothed tiger. The Smilodon is the prehistoric cat that is best known to researchers. In truth, all modern day cats, including tigers, came from a completely different line.
Ground-source or water-source heat pumps can be used in more extreme climates than air-source heat pumps, and customer satisfaction with the systems is very high. A new type of heat pump for residential systems is the absorption heat pump, also called a gas-fired heat pump.bsorption heat pumps use heat as their energy source, and can be driven with a wide variety of heat sources. For more information on these specific types of heat pumps, go to: 1  Air-Source Heat Pumps. 2  Ductless Mini-Split Heat Pumps. 3  Geothermal Heat Pumps.
Types of Heat Pumps. The most popular type of heat pump is an air-to-air heat pump, or air-source heat hump (ASHP). These are often mounted to the interior of a wall and used mostly in moderate climates, as performance can lag when temperatures get below 35 degrees Fahrenheit. heat pump is equipment that uses a refrigerant to move heat from one place to another. During the summer, a heat pump captures heat from inside a home and transfers it to the outdoor air through a condensing unit.
All-electric furnaces have AFUE ratings of 95 percent to 100 percent, but they are not economical is many parts of the country. You can also consider electric heat pumps to heat or cool parts or all of your home. Some heat pumps can be added onto furnaces as well, to help use less gas or propane.Radiant floors, or hydronic heating systems, often use piping under a floor.ll-electric furnaces have AFUE ratings of 95 percent to 100 percent, but they are not economical is many parts of the country. You can also consider electric heat pumps to heat or cool parts or all of your home. Some heat pumps can be added onto furnaces as well, to help use less gas or propane.
If you heat with electricity, a heat pump can trim the amount of electricity you use for heating by as much as 30% to 40%. High-efficiency heat pumps also dehumidify better than standard central air conditioners, resulting in less energy usage and more cooling comfort in summer months.bsorption heat pumps use heat as their energy source, and can be driven with a wide variety of heat sources.

One great way to get more efficient heating and cooling in your home is with a heat pump. But don't think heat pumps are just for heating. Many can be used for both heating and air conditioning. In fact, many ductless mini-split air conditioning units also operate as heat pumps.A heat pump is equipment that uses a refrigerant to move heat from one place to another.During the summer, a heat pump captures heat from inside a home and transfers it to the outdoor air through a condensing unit. heat pump is equipment that uses a refrigerant to move heat from one place to another. During the summer, a heat pump captures heat from inside a home and transfers it to the outdoor air through a condensing unit.
In most American households, heating is provided by one of two types of HVAC systems: a heat pump or a furnace. Both types of heating systems are effective and reliable.he heat pump contains a set of coils in the indoor unit and another in the outdoor unit. When the system is providing heating, the refrigerant in the outdoor coils is evaporated into a gas, which absorbs heat.
Hybrid Heat Split System. A Carrier hybrid heat split system is a more energy-efficient variation of the traditional heating and air conditioning split system. The inclusion of a heat pump allows the option of electricity-fueled heating and air conditioning, in addition to gas furnace heat.VAC System Types. There are 4 primary types of heating and. cooling systems: split systems, hybrid heat split systems, duct-free split systems and packaged systems.
Absorption heat pumps use heat as their energy source, and can be driven with a wide variety of heat sources.

The combustion fuel half of the system could be propane, natural gas, oil, or even coal and wood. In comparison with a combustion fuel-fired furnace or standard heat pump alone, this type of system is also economical. Actual energy savings depend on the relative costs of the combustion fuel relative to electricity.bsorption heat pumps use heat as their energy source, and can be driven with a wide variety of heat sources.

Refrigerators and air-conditioning systems are really just one-way heat pumps (or a half-heat pump). Because they move heat rather than generate heat, heat pumps can provide up to four times the amount of energy they consume in electricity, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. heat pump is equipment that uses a refrigerant to move heat from one place to another. During the summer, a heat pump captures heat from inside a home and transfers it to the outdoor air through a condensing unit.
What are nucleic acids made of? A nucleotide contains three components: a phosphate group, a sugar and a nitrogenous base. The phosphate group and sugar are bonded together to make the backbone portion of a nucleic acid. In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose; in RNA, the sugar is ribose.
DNA and its close relative RNA are perhaps the most important molecules in biology. They contains the instructions that make every single living organism on the planet. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid and RNA for ribonucleic acid. They are polymers (long chain molecules) made from nucleotides.
DNA is the genetic material, and genes are made of DNA. DNA therefore has two essential functions: replication and expression. Replication means that the DNA, with all its genes, must be copied every time a cell divides.
DNA is the genetic material, and genes are made of DNA. DNA therefore has two essential functions: replication and expression. 1  Replication means that the DNA, with all its genes, must be copied every time a cell divides.  Expression means that the genes on DNA must control characteristics.
What do DNA and RNA have in common? A nucleotide contains three components: a phosphate group, a sugar and a nitrogenous base. The phosphate group and sugar are bonded together to make the backbone portion of a nucleic acid. In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose; in RNA, the sugar is ribose.
Long chains of nucleotides are called nucleic acids. Two types of nucleic acids are found in organisms: deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid. DNA consists of two nucleotide chains bonded to and wrapped around one another in a twisted ladder shape called a double helix.
The image in the center shows the structure of DNA. Note that there are two strands: one shown in blue, one in yellow. Other examples of a helix include yarn, a phone cord, or a spiral staircase. Each chain of the double helix is made up of repeating units called nucleotides. A single nucleotide is composed of three functional groups: a sugar, a triphosphate, and a nitrogenous (nitrogen-containing) base, as shown below.

Nucleotides and the double helix. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the heritable material found in all cells. DNA provides the instructions to build, maintain, and regulate cells and organisms and is passed on when cells divide and when organisms reproduce.
DNA is made of repeating units called nucleotides. The four nucleotides in DNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine. Adenine binds with thymine, and guanine binds with cytosine.
After menopause, women can experience a shrinkage of their fibroid tumors. Menopause means that the reproductive hormones, including estrogen, are decreasing; because fibroid tumors thrive on estrogen, this means the tumors will decrease in size.
Fibroid tumors are sensitive to changes in a woman's monthly hormone cycle. As estrogen levels tend to increase before menopause starts, many uterine fibroids start to grow. This may make the symptoms worse. After menopause, estrogen falls dramatically.
What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Uterine Fibroids After Menopause? Fibroid tumors, which are generally noncancerous growths in and/or around the uterus, can still cause significant issues for a woman's health after menopause; her general, as well as gynecological, health can be affected. Fibroid tumors, although bothersome, are usually not dangerous. Fibroid tumors can cause pelvic pain and pain during intercourse.
Uterine fibroids are tumors that are not cancerous that grow on or in the muscles of the uterus (womb). They are sometimes called myoma, leiomyoma, leiomyomata and fibromyoma. All women are at risk of developing fibroids at some point in their lives. They are the most common tumor of the female reproductive system.
Every womanâs body is different though. Menopause may not cause the fibroids to shrink at all, and they may even continue growing. Some women have continued to experience painful symptoms from fibroids after menopause.
Some of the uterine fibroid symptoms that may still persist after menopause include: 1  Pelvic pressure: You may continue to experience severe pain similar to cramps before a period.  Urinary urgency: If the fibroids are pushing on the bladder, it can cause you to have to urinate frequently.
Symptoms of fibroids following menopause. Some of the uterine fibroid symptoms that may still persist after menopause include: Pelvic pressure: You may continue to experience severe pain similar to cramps before a period. This pain can be extreme and can be a result of the fibroids pressing on the walls of the uterus and surrounding organs.
While in many instances, fibroids have been shown to shrink after menopause, this may not always be the case. Although often menopause causes fibroids to shrink, this may not mean that the problems and symptoms associated with fibroids will disappear completely.
1 Submucosal fibroids develop just under the lining of the uterine cavity. These are the least common type of fibroid tumor. They often cause very heavy, long menstrual periods.  Pedunculated uterine fibroids occur when the fibroid grows on a stalk. These can grow into the uterus or on the outside of the uterus.
Some women experience no symptoms. Women sometimes underestimate the impact of their symptoms because they have gotten used to the excessive bleeding, pain and the pressure that fibroids can cause. When there are symptoms, they vary depending on the location and size of the fibroid tumors.
Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci.Penicillins are still widely used today, though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use.All penicillins are Î²-lactam antibiotics.enicillin (PCN or pen) is a group of antibiotics which include penicillin G (intravenous use), penicillin V (oral use), procaine penicillin, and benzathine penicillin (intramuscular use).

Antibiotics are medications that fight infections caused by bacteria, but the flu is cause by a virus. Taking antibiotics when you have a virus may do more harm than good. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of get ting an infection later that may resist antibiotic treatment.ntibiotics only cure certain infections due to bacteria -- and if taken carelessly, you may get more serious health problems than you bargained for. With any illness, it is critical to address the underlying cause, whether it's bacterial or viral.
An antibiotic is given for the treatment of an infection caused by bacteria. Antibiotics target microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and parasites. However, they are not effective against viruses. If you have an infection it is important to know whether it is caused by bacteria or a virus.Most upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold and sore throats are generally caused by viruses-antibiotics do not work against these viruses.lthough there are a number of different types of antibiotic they all work in one of two ways: 1  A bactericidal antibiotic kills the bacteria. 2  Penicillin is a bactericidal. 3  A bactericidal usually either interferes with the formation of the bacterium's cell wall or its cell contents.
Bacteria become resistant more quickly when antibiotics are used too often or are not used correctly (such as not taking a full course of antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor). Bacteria that are resistant to one antibiotic can sometimes be treated with other antibiotics.These other medicines may have to be given intravenously (through a vein) in a hospital. A few kinds of bacteria are resistant to all antibiotics and are now untreatable. Ear infections. 2  There are several types of ear infections. 3  Antibiotics are used for some (but not all) ear infections. 4  Sinus infections. 5  Antibiotics are often used to treat sinus infections. 6  However, a runny nose and yellow or green mucus do not necessarily mean you need an antibiotic.
A broad-spectrum antibiotic can be used to treat a wide range of infections. A narrow-spectrum antibiotic is only effective against a few types of bacteria. There are antibiotics that attack aerobic bacteria, while others work against anaerobic bacteria. Aerobic bacteria need oxygen, while anaerobic bacteria don't.lthough there are a number of different types of antibiotic they all work in one of two ways: 1  A bactericidal antibiotic kills the bacteria. 2  Penicillin is a bactericidal. 3  A bactericidal usually either interferes with the formation of the bacterium's cell wall or its cell contents.

Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Bacteria are microscopic organisms, some of which may cause illness. The word bacteria is the plural of bacterium. Such illnesses as syphilis, tuberculosis, salmonella, and some forms of meningitis are caused by bacteria.lthough there are a number of different types of antibiotic they all work in one of two ways: 1  A bactericidal antibiotic kills the bacteria. 2  Penicillin is a bactericidal. 3  A bactericidal usually either interferes with the formation of the bacterium's cell wall or its cell contents.
Antibiotics are strong medicines used to treat infections, including life-threatening contagious diseases. But antibiotics can cause more harm than good when they aren't used the right way. You can protect yourself and your family by knowing when you should use antibiotics and when you should not.

Antibiotics kill bacteria, not archaea, fungi, or protists. The discovery of the antibiotic penicillin in the 1920s made a big impact on human history. Not only did it lead to a cure for bacterial infections that were once deadly, but it also led a big interest in finding new antibiotics.he discovery of the antibiotic penicillin in the 1920s made a big impact on human history.

I was told I was donor-conceived at a very young age ... as I got older I became more curious about that half of my DNA, Kramer of Nederland, Colo., said. With mom Wendy's approval, Kramer set off on a mission to find his sperm-donor dad. Son's Search for Sperm-Donor Dad Leads to Siblings.
With mom Wendy's approval, Kramer set off on a mission to find his sperm-donor dad. Son's Search for Sperm-Donor Dad Leads to Siblings. I didn't need a father ... what I wanted was to just see a picture of him or have a conversation, he said, adding that he was looking for answers more than anything else.

Finding Family: After you add a posting to the DSR, you will then get automatic DSR emails when you have a match, when a DSR member has sent you a message, and when anyone who has used your donor adds information to the medical page that is specifically for your donor.
Also, there's no tracking of the number of children a single sperm donor can have, which many men are not aware of when they donate. I have donors that come to my site all the time and say, 'Wait a minute, I just came to your website and I see that I have 22 children.
Trust me if they want to find out more about their donor, its not saying that they want to know who their father is cause they know they have one and always will. You will always be their father and it makes you no less of a man. My Dad is the greatest Dad and I couldnât have asked for any better.
You can use a sperm bank to locate a donor or you can search through our profiles of sperm donors and co-parents who are willing to donate sperm free of charge. Some donors wish to have occasional contact with the child and others would like to be more involved and wish to co-parent.
Boy's Search for Biological Siblings. Kramer's real-life journey began on  Good Morning America  in 2002 when the 12-year-old read a note he penned to his local sperm bank.
Meeting the donor also allows you to get to know a little about the person, ensuring that they are the type of person who is right for you. It is important to consider your personal safety when meeting with prospective sperm donors or co-parents. Initially meet in public areas and take a third person along.
Or to have my brotherâs eyes and my fatherâs nose. This is why It is of the uttermost importance to me to find my biological others. The hardest thing about my whole experience is the fact that my Dad isnât my blood. I love him and look up to him so much that I just want to be a part of him.

Fulfilled Prophecy concerning Jesus. Though there are other religions that have prophecies in them, none are 100% accurate as is the Bible, and none of them point to someone like Jesus who made incredible claims and performed incredible deeds.t could not be that Jesus is the only Truth and other religions also be the truth. Either Jesus is true and all other religions are false, or other religions are true, and Jesus is false. There are no other options.
Justification by faith. Christians believe in justification by faith-that through their belief in Jesus as the Son of God, and in his death and resurrection, they can have a right relationship with God whose forgiveness was made once and for all through the death of Jesus Christ.he New Testament records that Jesus taught his disciples how to pray and that he encouraged them to address God as Father. Christians believe that they continue this tradition.
Christians recognise Jesus as the Son of God who was sent to save mankind from death and sin. Jesus Christ taught that he was Son of God. His teachings can be summarised, briefly as the love of God and love of one's neighbour.Jesus said that he had come to fulfil God's law rather than teach it.he New Testament records that Jesus taught his disciples how to pray and that he encouraged them to address God as Father. Christians believe that they continue this tradition.
For them the death of Jesus was part of a divine plan to save humanity. The death and resurrection of this one man is at the very heart of the Christian faith. For Christians it is through Jesus's death that people's broken relationship with God is restored. This is known as the Atonement.he cross as sacrifice. The image of Jesus' death as a sacrifice is the most popular in the New Testament. The New Testament uses the Old Testament image of the Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53:5) and applies it to Christ.
That is why Jesus was a Jew and we are Catholics: Jesus came to complete the Jewish religion by creating a Church that would serve as its fulfillment and be open to people of all races, not just ethnic Jews.nswer. The term Jew is used in at least two senses in Scripture: to refer to those who are ethnically Jews and to those who are religiously Jews. Jesus was a Jew in both senses. In fact, he completed the Jewish religion by serving as the Messiah (Christ) whom the prophets had long foretold.
The Jews hate Jesus Christ because they do not like being in a position of âweakness.â For one to come to Jesus Christ he has to admit that he has sinned and in need of a Saviour and therefore must repent and correct his conduct.The Jews find this absolutely abhorrent. The Jews do not want a Saviour.asically we were told in our Jewish circles, âJesus Christ is for the Gentiles not for us Jews.â. It wasnât until I started college in 1968 that I was able to buy a New Testament and read about Jesus Christ. I was amazed at how âJewishâ the New Testament was.

Many Christians believe in retribution. They want a God who tells them that there should be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, and they become furious when anyone suggests another kind of God who asks them to be merciful and forgiving. The God of grace is not to their liking.Instead, they want a God who punishes people tit for tat, and even beyond that, they want a God who will provide infinite punishment for limited sin. The God revealed in Jesus Christ is far too generous.any Christians believe in retribution.

The central tenet of Christianity is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah (Christ). Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah, was anointed by God as savior of humanity, and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament.hristianity began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the mid-1st century. Originating in Judea, it quickly spread to Europe, Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, Egypt, Ethiopia, and India and by the end of the 4th century had become the official state church of the Roman Empire.
I do not like that you said Jesus is not an American. Obviously He was born in Bethlehem and is not from North America. The rhetorical implication here, is that Americans are not true Christians. There is a VERY judgemental and anti-American bias in the writings of this red letter group.As a fellow follower of Jesus and as an American I would like to remind you of some thing that is easy to forget.any Christians believe in retribution.

How to Answer Behavioral Questions About Teamwork. Weâve all had team experiences â on the job, during school, in a volunteer or extracurricular role. Before your next job interview, sit down and make a list of the significant team projects that you remember.
All job seekers should be prepared to answer behavioral interview questions (âTell me about a timeâ¦â) about working on a team. Based on my experience consulting with both hiring organizations and job seekers, I can tell you that teamwork questions are the most common of all of the behavioral interview questions.
In the most effective teams, communication happens regularly. Interactions across team members as well as to and from team leaders are all necessary. Regular team meetings are a good way to discuss ongoing activities and new assignments, but if a crisis arises, discussion shouldnât wait until a team meeting takes place.
5 Qualities that Make a Good Team Player Great. Strong team players are the backbone of any team. When others fail, these are the people who venture on with strong resolve and persistence, committed to getting the job done.
Keys to Successful Teamwork. These ten tips describe the environment that must occur within the team for successful teamwork to take place. Successful teamwork is the cornerstone for creating functioning, contributing teams. The team understands the goals and is committed to attaining them.
The most effective teamwork happens when individual contributors harmonize their efforts and work toward a common goal. Good teams donât typically happen by accident; hard work, commitment and some amount of struggle are usually involved in creating successful teams. But teams that go through the rigors of creating a cohesive group are rewarded with higher productivity, fewer internal struggles and a more enjoyable work experience.
In the interview, they will be trying to get a sense of what you would be like to work with. Inside Big Interview, our complete training system for job interviews, we give you video lessons, sample answers, and an interactive practice tool for all of these different versions of teamwork-related interview questions.

In the electromagnetic spectrum, Infrared rays has higher wavelength than the visible rays and the ultraviolet rays has smaller wavelength as compared to the visible light. Also we have seen that the visible light contains different types of colors when the light is made to pass through the prism.
Electromagnetic radiation such as visible light is commonly treated as a wave phenomenon, characterized by a wavelength or frequency. Wavelength is defined on the left below, as the distance between adjacent peaks (or troughs), and may be designated in meters, centimeters or nanometers (10 -9 meters).
The full range of wavelengths for light is called the electromagnetic spectrum.. The image and table below show which wavelength ranges in the electromagnetic spectrum correspond to which types of light. Constants. 1  Home.
Frequency of wa ves is inversely proportional to their wavelength, which means that higher the wavelength, lower is the frequency and vice versa. The frequency range of the visible light is between 400 to 790 THz.
When visible light falls on a substance, some of the light energy gets refracted, some gets refracted, and some gets absorbed by the substance. Visible light transmittance is defined as the fraction of incident light on the substance which passes through the substance at a particular frequency or wavelength.
455 - 390. The order of colors in light, arranged from shortest wavelength to longest, is called the visible spectrum of light. The image below shows light's visible spectrum, which runs from violet to red. You might recognize the spectrum as the order of colors in a rainbow.
Long Wavelength Visible Light is the Red visible light. The wavelength of the Red visible light ranges from the 625 nm to the 750 nm. The Smallest Wavelength Visible Light is the Violet visible light. The violet visible light has wavelength which ranges from 380 nm to 435 nm.
The energy associated with a given segment of the spectrum is proportional to its frequency. The bottom equation describes this relationship, which provides the energy carried by a photon of a given wavelength of radiation. To obtain specific frequency, wavelength and energy values use this calculator.
The Sun is a natural source for visible light waves and our eyes see the reflection of this sunlight off the objects around us. The color of an object that we see is the color of light reflected. All other colors are absorbed. Light bulbs are another source of visible light waves. The color of an object that we see is the color of light reflected. All other colors are absorbed.  The color of an object that we see is the color of light reflected.
Frequency is the number of wave cycles that travel past a fixed point per unit of time, and is usually given in cycles per second, or hertz (Hz). Visible wavelengths cover a range from approximately 400 to 800 nm. The longest visible wavelength is red and the shortest is violet. Other common colors of the spectrum, in order of decreasing wavelength, may be remembered by the mnemonic: ROY G BIV. The wavelengths of what we perceive as particular colors in the visible portion of the spectrum are displayed and listed below. In horizontal diagrams, such as the one on the bottom left, wavelength will increase on moving from left to right. 1  Violet: 400 - 420 nm. 2  Indigo: 420 - 440 nm.
To become a pediatric neurologist, you should be prepared to complete intense education requirements. Some individuals who aspire to pursue this career option will begin taking related coursework during the high school years. The high school years can be used to get basic science requirements out of the way. To become a pediatric neurologist, you will need to complete a total of eleven years of education. If you are able to obtain college credit during high school, then you may be able to shave some time off of this figure. You will need to obtain a four-year degree from a college in order to attend medical school.

Feb 23 2014. A decade after filming Brokeback Mountain, Anne Hathaway is spilling a lot secrets about the film. Originally Hathaway read for the part of Alma, that eventually went to Michelle Williams. Hathaway was instead cast as rodeo rider Lureen, at her own request. I said, 'Oh no, no, no, no, no. I'm not Alma.

Mountain Breaks the Bank. December 13th, 2005. Brokeback Mountain had the best per theatre average of the year, and the best for a Live Action film of all time. The film earned an unbelievable $547,425 in 5 theatres for an average of $109,485.
10 Years After Brokeback Mountain: Just How Far Has Hollywood Come Since Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal's Epic Screen Romance? Thinking about Brokeback Mountain today, 10 years after the landmark film opened in theaters, stirs up an interesting mixture of emotions. Of course there's the blink of surprise when you think about the amount of time that's passedâit seems both not that long and so long ago.
Brokeback Mountain was released in London on December 30, 2005, in only one cinema, and was widely released in the rest of the United Kingdom on January 6, 2006. On January 11, Time Out London magazine reported that Brokeback was the number one film in the city, a position it held for three weeks.
Ten years ago this week, the Ang Lee film Brokeback Mountain first opened in theaters. Ask anyone today about it, and they can probably tell you two things about it: Itâs about gay cowboys and it featured one of Heath Ledgerâs most celebrated performances.
Jack Twist. For the fictional criminal, see Strangers (Dean Koontz novel). Jack Twist is a fictional character of the short story Brokeback Mountain by Annie Proulx and the 2005 Academy Award-winning film adaptation of the same name directed by Ang Lee, where he is portrayed by American actor Jake Gyllenhaal.
Two years before the release of Brokeback Mountain, Lee directed a very different sort of movie: The Hulk. He told Out that Brokeback proved to be the movie he needed to make next. âAfter The Hulk I thought about retirement. I thought Iâd had enough.
Gay marriage did not become legal in Wyomingâwhere Brokeback Mountain was set between 1963 and 1983âuntil Oct. 21, 2014, and the U.S. Supreme Court just ruled in June that states couldn't deny same-sex couples the right to marry.
Of the 13 awards the Screen Actors Guild will hand out on January 29th, 2006, five will be awarded to theatrical releases. And like past awards nominations, Brokeback Mountain again led the way, with four in total.

Myrmecophobia is an intense fear of ants. This fear belongs to the more general category of Entomophobias (the fear of insects). But the fear of bees and fear of ants are more specific as the sufferers only fear those respective classes of insects. Myrmecophobia is derived from the Greek word Myrmex meaning âantsâ and phobos which stands for the âGreek God of fearâ. Myrmecophobic individuals are, in a sense, similar to Arachnophobes- (people who fear spiders) in that; they might shudder or cry at the sight of ants just like the latter might do at the sight of spiders.
The English suffixes -phobia, -phobic, -phobe (of Greek origin: ÏÏÎ²Î¿Ï/ÏÎ¿Î²Î¯Î±) occur in technical usage in psychiatry to construct words that describe irrational, disabling fear as a mental disorder (e.g. agoraphobia). In common usage they also form words that describe dislike or hatred of a particular thing or subject. The suffix is antonymic to -philia, -philic, -phile (e.g. cibophobia, fear of food, and cibophilia, love of food).

. . and the heartâ belong to the sculptor, in which case the idea is that the sculptor âmockedâ (âmimicked,â âimitated in stoneâ) the passions and âfedâ them by creating them in stone, or if the hand and the heart belong to Ozymandias, whose hand mocked the passions of his foes and whose. heart fed his own passions.
In the poem âOzymandiasâ by Pershy Bissy Shelley, The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed in line 8, it is an instance of Synecdoche and Alliteration. The hand that mock'd them makes reference to the sculptor who mocked the PharaonÂ´s passions by chiseling into the stone.
During his reign he built temples, statues, and monuments. The statue in this poem was originally 57 feet high but is now vast and trunkless legs of stone half buried in the sand. The statue is at the site of the ancient Egyptian capital, Thebes.
A rhetorical term for a text that has an alternative or deeper meaning in addition to its apparent or surface meaning. Jay Heinrichs defines adianoeta as an  ironic figure of hidden meaning (Word Hero, 2011). See also: 1  Allegory. 2  Ambiguity and Lexical Ambiguity.
About the Poem: Ozymandias is the Greek name for Ramses the Great, born in 1314 bc. He was the third king of the 19th dynasty. He ruled Egypt for 66 years and was the ruler during the Biblical time when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt.
1 Hand is a stand-in for the sculptor. 2  So the sculptor both belittled and copied this man's passions.  3 The heart that fed is a tricky phrase; it refers to the heart that fed or nourished the passions of the man that the statue represents.
In the poem âDarknessâ by Lord Byron, Byron personifies ships when he states lay rotting on the sea and they slept on the abyss. Line 5 in the same poem, the author uses alliteration of the âbâ sound to reinforce the idea of blackness.
The statue in this poem was originally 57 feet high but is now vast and trunkless legs of stone half buried in the sand. The statue is at the site of the ancient Egyptian capital, Thebes.
Hence, Ozymandias is simply a ruler of air or a ruler of nothing. It is then obvious that the King of Kings spoken of in the poem is actually nature itself. Nature never disappears and nature represents the immortality not represented by the Ramses or any other individual or possession.
Q.what does it mean if your blood pressure is 112/77 and your heart rate is always between 90 and 109. A. It means as far as blood pressure and heart rate, you are in a normal range. That's a good thing.
Another cause of an abnormal heart beat is an arrhythmia. Given your history of hypertension, you are at risk for an arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation. This is potentially dangerous and increases your risk of stroke. I encourage you to discuss these symptoms with a cardiologist.
If your heart is skipping beats just here and there and not all the time, and it doesn't cause you pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, pressure in or on the chest or clammy sweating then you can call your doctor's office to make an appointment to have it checked out.
What to Know About Thumps, Flutters and Skipped Beats. When it comes to heart palpitations, the increased awareness around heart attack symptoms has been a double-edged sword. On one hand, growing knowledge about heart disease has made us savvier about our bodily symptoms.
I am 60 yrs old, and have had issues with my blood pressure. It goes up and down. I only take a diuretic, no other meds except ibuprofen. Very often, when I lay down to rest, my heart beats really hard for a few minutes. I understand how these symptoms may be concerning. I encourage you to discuss this with your cardiologist, who can help determine the precise cause after a thorough, in-person evaluation. Many different factors affect your heart beat.
So if you are having the above mentioned symptoms with the skipped beats, you should call 911 especially if you have chest pain or pressure and/or dizziness and sweating with the skipped beats. Whatever the case, your heart needs to be evaluated by a doctor.
Q.Im a 56 yearsold woman and wanted to know what my heart rate should be when riding a stationary bike at the gym. A. Hi The problem here is, the harder you work the higher you heart rate will be, and as you slow down so will you heart, and this would go along with... View All 4 Answers.
If itâs under 100 beats per minute, and you are feeling okay, you are probably not experiencing a serious rhythm disturbance.â. Exercise, of course, will raise your heart rate above 100, and thatâs good (as long as you donât exceed your target heart rate). But a resting pulse that suddenly rises to 100 beat per minute or more can be a sign of tachycardia â a more serious disturbance in the rhythm of the heart.
Heart Dysrhythmias, Irregular Pulse, Missed beats and Palpitations. Contents. A normal person's heart should beat somewhere between 60 and 80 beats per minute with the rate slightly speeding up as one breathes in and slightly slowing down as one breathes out. Fit athletes have a slower pulse because as a result of training the heart beats more powerfully at rest.
But go to the doc to get real help A.S.A.P There are many reasons for skipped heart beats and many kinds of skipped heart beats. Some of them don't mean anything, and some of them mean you should get to your doctor soon, and some of them mean you need to call 911.
Steve Greenberg (@steviegpro) is the founder of S-Curve Records and a Grammy winning record producer who had an integral role in developing the careers of Hanson, Joss Stone and the Jonas Brothers, among many others.Here, he reflects on the 50-year-old perennial Halloween hit Monster Mash..
By the time Monster Mash hit No. 1 in late October, all the aforementioned Twist records were gone from the charts, the kids were on to other dances like the Swim or the Loco-Motion, and Chubby Checker would never have another Top 10 record, after a 2-year run in which he'd had eight of them.
Monster Mash is a 1962 novelty song and the best-known song by Bobby Boris Pickett.
Hello all!! Mary back from Little Mama Bowtique and SO excited to share my Monster Mash Bow with you! I got a little carried away with this one and spent an entire afternoon on it, but I think it was well worth it.
As I write this the day before Halloween, Monster Mash by Bobby Boris Pickett sits at No. 25 on the iTunes pop singles chart. Click over to Spotify and you'll find over 50 versions of the song to choose from-one of them by John The Cool Ghoul Zacherle, even.
To make the bottle cap center you will need a 1 inch hole punch, an epoxy dome sticker, and bottle cap image. I found my image HERE. I also made a little glitter bow with a sequin to attach a Frankenstein Monster so she of course, had a bow too! Last but not least, take your choice of partially lined clip either alligator or French and attach it to back of your new bow. I used a French Barrett as this bow got heavy and is great for pony tails.

Fifty years since its initial release, Bobby Boris Pickett 's Monster Mash has long since entered the pantheon of holiday evergreens, the Halloween equivalent of Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer or Frosty The Snowman. This is in itself an impressive feat.
I love that song and find myself skipping along the whole month of October to that tune while it jams out in my mind. So, it is with great pleasure that I introduce this awwwwesome and oh so very spooky Monster Mash Halloween Bow brought to us by the fabulous and brilliant bow makerâ¦Mary from Little Mama Bowtique! Just try not to hum the famous Monster Mash tune while checking out this festive bowâ¦I dare you.

The main symptom of sialorrhea is drooling, which may not pose a problem but is rather an embarrassment. It can lead to cracking of the lips and irritation of the skin around the lips. The skin may become infected if left untreated. Some patients may actually choke on the excess saliva which can lead to coughing.
Medical Therapy. Treatment of patients with drooling problems has been successful at some centers using a team approach, including an otolaryngologist, pediatric dentist, speech pathologist, and physical therapist. Aggressive physical medicine or medical management prior to considering surgical intervention is recommended.

A film that combines comedy, drama, pathos and political manoeuvring, The Death of Stalin is a Quad and Main Journey production, directed by Armando Iannucci, and produced by Yann Zenou, Kevin Loader, Nicolas Duval Assakovsky, and Laurent Zeitoun.
Death of Stalin ramps this up to its purest form, depicting a sphere of government within which the will of the people is dismissed as irrelevant, and the stakes of political battles are not just jobs but life and death. Iannucci has said that heâs done with satire now that Donald Trump is president, but even this isnât really satire.
Sify.com gave it 3 on 5 stars as well and stated The much hyped Murugadoss directed Stalin does not have Chiru as the comic book superhero in the first half. He is basically a do-gooder for his fellow-men as he attempts to make the world a better place to live.
The internal political landscape of 1950âs Soviet Russia takes on darkly comic form in a new film by Emmy award-winning and Oscar-nominated writer/director Armando Iannucci.

The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is 45â65%. If, for instance, you ate 1600 kcals per day, the acceptable carbohydrate intake ranges from 180 grams to 260 grams. Most American adults consume about half of their calories as carbohydrates.
For children age 4 and over, it is 10â30%, and for younger children, the range is 5â20%. For an adult consuming 1600 kcals per day, the acceptable protein intake ranges from 40â140 grams per day, an amount easily met. Consider the 200-pound bodybuilder whose protein needs are approximately 155 grams per day.
There are no available population intake data for Australia. New Zealand is a known low selenium area, thus recommendations based on centiles of population intakes are inappropriate. Selenium-rich foods include seafood, poultry and eggs and to a lesser extent, other muscle meats.
The suggested dietary target is equivalent to the 90th centile of intake in the Australian and New Zealand populations, to be attained by replacing nutrient-poor, energy-dense foods and drinks with plenty of red-yellow vegetables and fruits, moderate amounts of reduced-fat dairy foods and small amounts of vegetable oils.
What is the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein? Correct Marks for this submission: 1/1. 11 Marks: 1 Choose one answer. a. The branched-chain amino acids constitute a significant amount of muscle tissue b. The potential energy contained in protein cannot be used in the human body c.
Fat is the most energy-dense macronutrient, which means it contains the most calories in each gram -- 1 g of fat provides 9 calories. If you consume 2,500 calories per day, your fat intake should range from 56 g to 97 g. Recommendations for fat are further specified by type of fat.
Carbohydrates, protein and fats are macronutrients, meaning the body requires them in relatively large amounts for normal functioning. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for carbohydrates for children and adults is 130 grams and is based on the average minimum amount of glucose used by the brain.
Like carbohydrates, protein provides 4 calories per 1 g. If you consume 2,500 calories, protein intake should fall between 63 g and 219 g. Because the AMDR for protein is such a wide range, you can also determine your protein needs by your body weight. You should consume 0.8 g of protein for every 1 kg of body weight.
The recommendations for macronutrient ratios in your diet are given as acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges. These ranges represent the percentage of your total calorie intake that should come from each specific nutrient.
The suggested dietary target is equivalent to the 90th centile of intake in the Australian/New Zealand population to be attained by replacing energy-dense, low nutrient foods and drinks with LC n-3-rich foods such as fish such as tuna, salmon and mackerel, lean beef or low energy density, LC n-3-enriched foods.

We've been describing fees in a way that really is nonsense. We ought to look at fees not in terms of assets, but as a percentage of the incremental returns of a fund -- how much extra return you can expect over a comparable index fund. Think of the 7% expected long-term returns of stocks. A 1.5% fund expense ratio is a big fraction of that 7%.

Both factors are possibly due to a misalignment of the pelvis.Itâs frequently associated with pregnancy and childbirth.A symphysis pubis dysfunction is a common and debilitating condition affecting woman. Itâs painful and it can have a significant impact on quality of life, which can lead to complications as depression. In British population we can see an incidence of 1:36 to 1:300.

1 The concrete and steel dam is 7,661 feet long, almost 600 feet high and used about 510,000 tons of steel â enough to build the Eiffel Tower sixty times. Some have claimed that the structure is visible from the moon, but this is not the case. 2  The power generated by the 34 generators is enormous.
Why Built the Three Gorges Dam. The Three Gorges Dam is the worldâs largest power producing facility, and the worldâs largest hydroelectric dam. There were many reasons for building the dam and this article will investigate some of these. The Three gorges dam was built across the Yangtze River to control the amount of water allowed through.
The Three Gorges Dam is being built on the Yangtze River in South Central China.
Why Built the Three Gorges Dam The Three Gorges Dam is the worldâs largest power producing facility, and the worldâs largest hydroelectric dam. There were many reasons for building the dam and this article will investigate some of these.
The need for a dam was even mentioned by Chairman Mao, who wrote a poem in the same year called Swimming. In it, he had visions of a large stone wall being built across the river, similar to the three gorges dam. By building a dam across the Yangtze River, it is possible to control the flow of water.
The three Gorges dam is built on Yangtze river. It is a hydro  electric project and has world's largest installed capacity (22,500  MW).
Here are ten facts about the Three Gorges Dam. 1  The Three Gorges Dam is a hydroelectric dam on the Yangtze River in China. In terms of the amount of electricity it generates, itâs the worldâs largest power station. 2  The Yangtze is the third longest river in the world, at almost 4,000 miles.
One of the main reasons that the Three Gorges dam was built was to prevent flooding further downstream. The need for a dam was highlighted in 1954 when people were killed as a result of flooding of the Yangtze River.
1 Over 100 towns and settlements were submerged when the dam was built. In addition, over 1,000 archaeological and historic sites were also submerged and lost. 2  The Chinese government estimates the dam will have cost $30 billion once completed. However, it should only take about 10 years to fully recover the costs.
The Three Gorges Dam was built by constructing the largest concrete  dam in history. It is at the confluence of three rivers and will  eventually flood millions of acres of â¦land, villages and fields.
Recovering junkie. Politician. Researcher. A 54-year survey of 26,285 European Swallows captured and released by the Avian Demography Unit of the University of Capetown finds that the average adult European swallow has a wing length of 12.2 cm and a body mass of 20.3 grams. Also, the average flight speed of an Unladen swallow is roughly 11 m/s. According to the Coconut Development Board of India, the average coconut weighs 600 grams. With these figures, one can calculate that, beating its wings 18 times a second, the swallow would start travelling at approximately 11m/s, and accelerate to about 11992 m/s.
I don't know but know where to find out. 1 depends on if it's dead or not. 1 As fast as it wants to be, 1 Do Not AMonty Make Satan Angry 1 Need more info, I need to know the weight of the swallow as well as its altitude to calculate its velocity.
that the average adult European swallow has a wing le ngth of 12.2 cm and a body mass of 20.3 grams.4. Because wing beat frequency and wing amplitude both scale with body mass, 5 and flight kinematic data is available for at least 22 other bird.

The account request procedure on DeepThought asks the applicant several questions (What is your name?, etc.) For its amusement value, it was suggested to me that I throw in the swallow question from the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
By averaging all 6 values, we can estimate that an average European Swallow flies at cruising speed with a frequency of roughly 15 beats per. second, and an amplitude of roughly 22 cm. Last monthâs article on The Strouhal Number in Cruising Flight showed how simplified flight waveforms that graph amplitude versus.

History >> Native Americans for Kids. Native Americans lived in a wide variety of homes. Different tribes and peoples built different types of homes. What kinds of homes they lived in depended on the materials that they had available where they lived. It also depended on the kind of lifestyle that they lived as well as the environment.
Quick Answer. Many Native Americans live on reservations located in several of the Southwestern and Midwestern states. Some Natives, however, have fully integrated into contemporary American society and live in metropolitan cities. Continue Reading.
People lived in the United States long before the arrival of Christopher Columbus and the Europeans. These people and cultures are called Native Americans. This page is an overview of Native Americans who lived in the United States. More details can be found in the links at the bottom of the page.
Native Americans lived throughout North and South America. In the United States there were Native Americans in Alaska, Hawaii, and the mainland of the United States. Different tribes and cultures lived in different areas.
E X H I B I T. Many people believe racial and ethnic groups in North America have always lived as separately as they do now. However, segregation was neither practical nor preferable when people who were not native to this continent began arriving here. Europeans needed Indians as guides, trade partners and military allies.
Other Native American Homes. 1  Plank house - Built by the natives in the Northwest near the coast, these homes were made from planks of a wood called cedar. Several families would live in a single home. 2  Igloo - Igloos were homes built by the Inuit in Alaska. Igloos are small domed homes made from blocks of ice.
As of 2012 70% of American Indians live in urban areas, up from 45% in 1970 and 8% in 1940. American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry reported in 2010 U.S. Census: 1â million in 5 Southwestern states: California â 1.0% 362,801.
A: American Indians, Native Americans, and First Nations people are synonyms. They all refer to the same people. Indigenous people is a broader term that refers to any culture that lived in a place first. So Native Americans are all indigenous people, but not all indigenous people are Native Americans. For example, native African cultures are also indigenous. Most indigenous people in the US use American Indian, and most indigenous people in Canada use First Nations.. Native Americans or indigenous Americans are frequently used to refer to people in both countries.
In 2011, about one in four American Indians and Alaska Natives1 (26.4 percent) lived in poverty. In contrast, about one in 10 non-Hispanic whites (11 percent) lived in poverty (U.S. Census Bureau 2013). Not surprisingly, the Native American population is a relatively low-wealth population. In 2000, Native Americansâ median wealth was equal to only 8.7 percent of the median wealth among all Americans (Chang 2010, 14). For most Americans, a home is a key source of wealth. Native Americans, however, have a significantly lower homeownership rate than whites, and the homes they do own tend to be worth much less than those of whites (Insight Center for Community Economic Development 2009, 1).
The first people to live in a land are called indigenous peoples. This means they were the original settlers. The Native Americans are the indigenous peoples and cultures of the United States. Sometimes these peoples are referred to as Indians or American Indians.

Broad. Pre WW II slang for an independent, assertive/aggressive woman. Usually in show business, a broad is a singer, dancer, actor or business-woman who sings loud, parties hard and is often abrasive, sarcastic and in-your-face.
Share. By Tom Head. Definition: A ciswoman, shorthand for cissexual woman or cisgender woman, is non-transsexual woman--a woman whose assigned gender is female, and whose assigned female gender is more or less consistent with her personal sense of self.
On a good lurk-on to a good thing. On ya mate-usually means well done but often used sarcastically. Open slather-free-for-all, anything goes. Oz-Australia. P. Piker-someone who doesn't want to do something especially within a group. Pissed-drunk.
In some pre-war Hollywood films, broads are portrayed as gangsters' girlfriends or even their accomplices or gun moll s but that was rarely the case in real life. Also in Hollywood films of the era, broads chewed gum incessantly and spoke with a thick, sarcastic New York accent.
Word for a woman. Less respectable than lady but much more respectable than bitch.
Dinkum / dinki-di-true, honest, genuine. Down the road-term indicating distance but no particular distance, it could be a few hundred metres but may be a few hundred miles. Drongo-slow-witted or stupid person. Dunny-an outside toilet, lavatory.
A term originated in the 1930's meaning woman; derived from the fact that the most defining characteristic of all females are their hips, which are proportionally wider than the hips of their male counterparts.
Tart-once meaning 'sweet heart' but now a derogatory word for a woman. Tee up-to organise something. Thingy / thingo / thingummyjig-any thing that doesn't have a precise name. Tightarse-someone who wont buy a drink or wont part with money. Tinnie-a can of beer.
A variation is the classy broad which implies she has either been born rich, snagged herself a sugar-daddy, or has succeeded on her own. Broads are generally moderately attractive or better, are never seen without their best dresses and perfect makeup, and know how to compete and win in a man's world.
This distinguishes her from transwomen, shorthand for  transsexual women--women who were initially assigned a male gender, but have a female identity. If you identify as a woman but are not a transsexual woman, you're a ciswoman. Cissexual and transsexual identity are grounded in gender roles.
The cuticle is composed of an insoluble cuticular membrane impregnated by and covered with soluble waxes. Cutin, a polyester polymer composed of inter-esterified omega hydroxy acids which are cross-linked by ester and epoxide bonds, is the best-known structural component of the cuticular membrane.
The cuticle is a multi-layer structure composed primarily of cutin, cutan, polysaccharides, lipids and waxes. On the inward-facing side of a leaf, the cuticle attaches to the epidermal plant cell walls, and on the outward-facing side, the cuticle forms a film or skin that covers the leaf surface.
Diffen âº Science âº Biology âº Botany. Angiosperms, also called flowering plants, have seeds that are enclosed within an ovary (usually a fruit), while gymnosperms have no flowers or fruits, and have unenclosed or ânakedâ seeds on the surface of scales or leaves. Gymnosperm seeds are often configured as cones.
A plant cuticle is a protecting film covering the epidermis of leaves, young shoots and other aerial plant organs without periderm. It consists of lipid and hydrocarbon polymers impregnated with wax, and is synthesized exclusively by the epidermal cells.
__A__45) Nonvascular plants are distinguished by the a) absence of xylem and phloem c) absence of cuticle b) presence of rhizomes d) presence of spores. __B__46) A seed is a) a modified spore c) produced on the gametophyte b) a plant embryo inside a protective coat d) All of the above.
The cuticle can also contain a non-saponifiable hydrocarbon polymer known as Cutan. The cuticular membrane is impregnated with cuticular waxes and covered with epicuticular waxes, which are mixtures of hydrophobic aliphatic compounds, hydrocarbons with chain lengths typically in the range C16 to C36.
A primary function of the leafâs waxy cuticle is to reduce water loss through the leaves, which is particularly important in arid deserts with little rainfall or Mediterranean climates with seasonal rainfall.
The plant cuticle is a layer of lipid polymer impregnated with waxes that is present on the outer surfaces of the primary organs of all vascular land plants.
The cuticle also works with the stomata to help complete photosynthesis. After the stomata open and carbon dioxide enters the leaf, the cuticle protects the mesophyll layer, which contains the photosynthetic cells that receive and process the carbon dioxide to manufacture glucose. The cuticle is translucent, so it does not block the sunâs rays from reaching the photosynthetic cells.
Since gymnosperms and angiosperms are both vascular plants, they have a sporophyte-dominant life-cycle. Tissue formation in angiosperms exceeds the amount and complexity found in gymnosperms. Angiosperms have a triploid vascular tissue, flat leaves in numerous shapes and hardwood stems.
However, urine color and odor can also be an indication of something more serious. Poop, another result of the digestive process, is also an important indication of health. Your diet has a lot to do with whether or not you have a good poop or a bad poop.
To diagnose the underlying cause of green stool, your doctor or licensed health care practitioner will ask you several questions related to your symptoms. You can best help your health care practitioner in diagnosing the underlying cause of green stool by providing complete answers to these questions:
For example, black poop may indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, most likely the stomach. It could be caused by iron supplements, Pepto-Bismol, or (oddly enough) black licorice. Light-colored, white, or clay-colored poop usually means a lack of bile in your stool or bile duct obstruction. Possible dietary causes include certain medications like anti-diarrheal drugs.
So while all of this waste product is making its way down the digestive tract, still yellowish green, bilirubin is broken down by gut bacteria, which turns it colorless, before reacting with oxygen to turn it brown. If this process happens too fast, your poop will remain that yellow/green color.
Green stool can also be a symptom of various intestinal disorders that interfere with the normal digestion process, such as Salmonella food poisoning. As food passes through the digestive system, a yellow-green fluid called bile that helps digest food changes color, resulting in a stool that is light to dark brown. However, when an infection such as Salmonella causes diarrhea, food and feces pass through the digestive tract quickly before changing to a brown color.
Stool comes in a range of colors. All shades of brown and even green are considered normal. Only rarely does stool color indicate a potentially serious intestinal condition. Stool color is generally influenced by what you eat as well as by the amount of bile â a yellow-green fluid that digests fats â in your stool. As bile pigments travel through your gastrointestinal tract, they are chemically altered by enzymes â changing the pigments from green to brown.
Stool is usually brown due to bilirubin, a substance made from hemoglobin that is produced when the liver processes dead, used-up red blood cells and gets them ready for secretion. Bilirubin starts off as yellow before it is secreted from the liver as bile, which is yellow/green. When bile makes its way through the small intestine, it digest fats by breaking down lipid molecules into fatty acids.
Green stool can be normal, but it can also be caused by a serious intestinal infection or other disorder. It is important to contact your health care provider when you develop a persistent color change in your stool.
Green stool can occur due to a normal or benign condition and not be a cause for concern. For example, you may produce green stool after consuming certain iron-rich foods or iron supplements, leafy green vegetables, or products with green food coloring.
Green stool can also be caused by taking iron supplements or eating certain foods such as green leafy vegetables. Green stool can also indicate a problem with food digestion due to a disease, disorder or other abnormal process. The normal color of stool or feces is generally light to dark brown. Stool gets its color from bile, which is a yellow-green fluid produced in the liver that helps to digest your food. As food passes through your digestive tract, digestive enzymes break down the bile, resulting in various shades of brown stool.

Bill's income is $850 from Social Security. Jane earns $400 per month from part time work. Bill is not eligible for QMB (or SLMB) because the state treats him as if he was single even though the state counts Jane's income. The fact that Jane's income is counted is what makes him ineligible. The QMB income limit for a single person is $981 per month and the SLMB income limit for a single person is $1,177. Bill is eligible for QI-1 because the QI-1 income limit for a single person is $1,325.
Eligibility for SLMB ends if the enrollee is no longer Medicare-eligible, or has excess income or assets. A person who becomes eligible for QMB may not receive SLMB. See QMB Eligibility Begin Date for more information.
SLMB does not have a six month or annual standard. Example : Myrtle is paid bi-weekly through her employer. In December, she will receive three paychecks and her income will be higher than the 120% FPG standard. Action: Myrtleâs total net income exceeds the standard in December. She is ineligible for SLMB in December.

Make sure the royal icing has the proper consistency. Too runny and it will run over the sides; too stiff and it won't spread nicely. So, for the right consistency, first test the icing by lifting your spoon and letting the icing drip back into the bowl.
Best Answer: If it is royal icing it is dependant on how thick you have made the icing. I haven't done mine yet I've been a bit lazy this year. Yours will be fine for Christmas day. It normally takes a couple of days to really set properly. Whatever you do don't put the cake in a fridge, just store it in a cool place.
The proper consistency is when the ribbon of icing that falls back into the bowl remains on the surface for about 5 seconds before disappearing. Another way is to take a cookie and place a small amount of icing in the middle of the cookie. Using a small knife or spatula, push the icing to the edge of the cookie. If the icing runs off the edge, thicken the icing by adding a little more confectioners sugar. Do not add too much sugar at once.
The oven worked. I was able to use them about 4 hours late and they stayed together pretty well. it was a transfer of a stork so I was a bit worried about the legs but whew - it worked! Dry time depends on a few things: (1) thickness of icing to start; (2) size of the transfer; and (3) ambient conditions . . . I've had teeny tiny flowers (1/4 inch) dry in less than 1/2 hour with no assistance from a dehydrator. But they can take longer depending on conditions noted.
Report Abuse. 1  you don't say what sort of icing it is. if its Royal it will take at least 2 hours or more to set. 2  at least 2 hours in the fridge. 3  10 minuites to half an hour, wait tilll its comletely hard and dry 4  ! If it hasn't set in an hour, it isn't going 5  to. Couple of hours should do it if you haven't made it too runny.
When it's humid I use dehumidifier to help manage moist air. You can also speed up drying process by baking icing cookies at the lowest oven setting(mine is 170F) for about 10-15 minutes) A nice crust will develop on the top. Icing maybe still wet under the crust, but you can continue with a second layer of royal icing decorations.
I place cookie on a tray and I air dry them, it helps to have a fan running close by to promote air circulation, it helps with faster drying, achieving nice smooth sheen finish on the icing. Don't cover drying cookies and don't put them into the fridge.
How to dry royal icing fast? up vote 7 down vote favorite. I'm going to lead a workshop for kids about decorating gingerbread cookies with royal icing. It will take place at a cafe, so I need the icing to be as dry as possible as fast as possible, otherwise the kids will not be able to take the cookies home or the icing might get broken on the way.

Angelou was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for her volume of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Die. A traumatic childhood. Maya was born and named Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 4, 1928. Her parents were Bailey, a naval dietician and doorman, and Vivian, a nurse and realtor.
(Photo: Getty Images). Today the nation mourns the passing of a national treasure, Dr. Maya Angelou, who has died at the age of 86. Considering todayâs low-barrier of entry into modern celebrity, her fame as a poet was as refreshing as it was far-reaching.
Since the early 1980s she has been Reynolds Professor and writer-in-residence at Wake Forest University. In the year 2000 she was honored by President Clinton with the National Medal of Arts, and in 2002 Hallmark introduced The Maya Angelou Life Mosaic Collection, a series of greeting cards containing her verse. She also has plans to write a cookbook and direct another feature film.
From 1961 to 1962, Angelou was the associate editor of the only English-language news weekly in the Middle East, the Arab Observer, in Cairo, Egypt. Angelou and Make divorced in 1963, and from 1964 to 1966, she was the feature editor of the African Review in Accra, Ghana.
In 1953, Maya changed her new surname to Angelou, for a stage name while performing at a San Francisco night club. She toured internationally, as a chorus member with the Everyman's Opera Company production of Porgy and Bess, from 1954 to 1955.
Maya Angelou recites her poem 'On the Pulse of Morning' at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton on January 20, 1993.
Angelou's second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, recounts her life from age 17 to 19. This book depicts a single mother's slide down the social ladder into poverty and crime,[20], Angelou at times working as a prostitute and as the madame of a brothel.
My mother was in The Blacks in 1960, and in that cast were Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, James Earl Jones, Godfrey Cambridge, Roscoe Lee Brown, Lou Gossett Jr., and there were so many more I can't even remember. In terms of musicians, Billie Holiday, Clifford Brown, Eric Dolphy, et cetera. And on the political side she headed Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference, so of course I met Martin Luther King. Muhammad Ali met Malcolm X for the time at my mother's house.
Eventful early life. Maya Angelou was born Marguerite Johnson on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri. After her parents' marriage ended, she and her brother, Bailey (who gave her the name Maya), were sent to rural Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother, who owned a general store.

Dorothy Dandridge Facts. Dorothy Dandridge (1922-1965) was the first African American woman to receive an Academy Award nomination for best actress for her performance in the 1954 film Carmen Jones. Her glamorous image and turbulent life have inspired many to compare her to another equally tragic Hollywood figure, Marilyn Monroe.
During this time, Dandridge and Vivian worked steadily but separately -- both longing to be free of Ruby's and Geneva's influence. But to truly pull away, both the girls got married in 1942. A 19-year-old Dorothy Dandridge wed 21-year-old Harold Nicholas in his mother's home on September 6, 1942.
A Rough Start. When Dorothy Dandridge was born in Cleveland, Ohio on November 9, 1922, her parents were already separated. Dorothyâs mother, Ruby Dandridge, was five months pregnant when she had left her husband, Cyril, taking their older daughter Vivian with her.
Starring Dorothy Dandridge - 3/12. She was beautiful, she could dance, she could sing, and she could act. Most importantly, she had that indefinable magnetism that attracts an audience and holds their attention. In short, she had everything it took to be a major star in the 1950s.
She was a woman of color and sometimes the color was tawny, and sometimes it was caramel, and sometimes it was the particular brown you might have made by stirring butter into molasses and warming them over a flame -- it was famous, this color, the color of Dorothy Dandridge's skin.
It was during this tour that Dorothy met Harold Nicholas, half of the popular Nicholas Brothers dance team, and the two fell in love. When the tour was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II in Europe, The Dandridge Sisters returned to Hollywood and Dorothy left the act to work as a solo performer.
Dorothy Dandridge and Jack Denison. Jack Denison and Dorothy Dandridge were married for 3 years. They dated for 1 year after getting together in Jun 1958 and married on 22nd Jun 1959. 3 years later they divorced on 20th Dec 1962.
Dorothy Dandridge, nominated as the doomed young tart in Carmen Jones, lost the Best Actress Award in 1954 and here are the actresses who lost it with her: Judy Garland (A Star is Born), Audrey Hepburn (Sabrina) and Jane Wyman (Magnificent Obsession).
Dorothy Dandridge was married to Jack Denison 1959-1962. She was an American actress and singer, and was the first African-American to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.She performed as a vocalist in venues such as the Cotton Club and the Apollo Theater.
There is a picture of Dorothy Dandridge taken just before that Mexico trip, a soft-focus photograph of a 42-year-old woman wearing something white and loose as she gazes out a window. She is sweetly pretty, rounded at the cheeks.
The Rooney Rule was adopted in 2003. It requires that all NFL clubs interview at least one person of color when seeking to fill a head coach opening. Since then, the Rooney Rule has been expanded to general manager jobs. A similar rule requires that a woman be interviewed for every business front-office position that opens in the league. Indeed, since 2007, there have been 10 Super Bowl teams with either a minority head coach or general manager.
Roger Goodell often has pointed to the Rooney Rule as one of the major achievements in his decade as commissioner. In February, during Super Bowl week, Goodell announced the NFL's expansion of the initiative to include women for front-office positions, lauding the rule Rooney helped design and put in place.
In place since 2003 for head coaches and expanded in 2009 to include general manager jobs and equivalent front-office positions, the rule â named after Dan Rooney, Pittsburgh Steelers chairman and onetime head of the leagueâs diversity committee â mandates that an NFL team must interview at least one minority candidate for these jobs.
The Rooney Rule is still evolving and growing pains are part of the process. But with the NFL on the right track, itâs definitely not time to slow down. More stories from The Undefeated:
Jeremi Duru wrote the book on the Rooney Rule. Literally. In Advancing The Ball: Race, Reformation, and the Quest for Equal Coaching Opportunity in the NFL, Duru masterfully details the history of the process that resulted in the rule.
Of all the contributions Dan Rooney made to the NFL, the Rooney Rule was the most important and far reaching. The policy on minority hiring that carries his name has been adopted not only by other sports but by businesses and organizations nationwide.
Thereâs no debating that the Rooney Rule has had a positive impact on the NFL. By providing owners with the first leaguewide tool to make hiring potentially more inclusive, the NFL took a significant step toward changing its culture.
The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports at the University of Central Florida found that: 1  At the start of last season, there were six head coaches of color, one more than in 2014. In 2011, the NFL had an all-time high of eight head coaches of color.
Many organizations have reached out to the NFL about how best to implement the rule. It has influenced thinking from federal government agencies to European sports leagues, Wooten and Carson said in their email. The Rooney Rule and its influence are a tribute to the man, but only one of many. Mr. Rooney loved the NFL and he loved his country, and when called upon by President Barack Obama to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, he took leave of one to serve the other, and he did so brilliantly.
But under the Rooney Rule, times were changing. âFor me, thatâs the one that really stood out,â said Jackson, now the Tennessee Titansâ assistant secondary coach. âIt was the Steelers. Thatâs one of those jobs that everyone looks at.

She completed the race that day in a blistering 10.70 seconds. Given that time, however, Fraser-Pryce is not the fastest woman in history.
She set herself the target of being the fastest woman to travel to every country in the world and she looks as if she is about to shatter that record (the current record stands at three years, three months and six days and is held by fellow American Yili Liu).

For a healthy daily calorie count, allow 10 calories per pound of body weight -- so a 150-pound woman should shoot for a 1,500-calorie target. That way, you should be able to lose weight no matter how much you exercise..
For example, an inactive adult should eat no more than .4 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day, while moderate exercisers and competitive athletes should consume .5 to .75 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. Excess protein will be stored in the body as fat.
How Does Nutrition Affect Exercise? The nutrients you consume can affect the quality of your exercise. The muscles you engage during exercise, whether itâs cardio, resistance training or flexibility work, rely on the nutrition you provide them through your diet. Supplying your body with nutrients before you work out, after you work out and in the recovery period between workouts can impact the quality of your session and affect your fitness goals. In some cases, fueling up during an exercise session can improve your results as well.
As a rule of thumb, weight loss is generally 75 percent diet and 25 percent exercise. An analysis of more than 700 weight loss studies found that people see the biggest short-term results when they eat smart. On average, people who dieted without exercising for 15 weeks lost 23 pounds; the exercisers lost only six over about 21 weeks.
Any exercise is better than none, and that helps your body slowly get used to being active. Your goal is to work up to half an hour most days of the week to get the full benefits from exercise. If it's more convenient, you can do short spurts -- 10 minutes here, 15 minutes there. Each action by itself may not seem like much, but they add up. Once youâre in better shape, you can gradually exercise for longer periods of time and do more strenuous activities.
Coordinating the intake of food and drinks will affect how nutrition works to improve overall fitness results. The Mayo Clinic reports that as the digestive system and muscles compete for energy, too much food intake prior to exercising can cause diarrhea and cramping.

Why is the fitness industry as a whole so anti-alcohol? Isn't there any room for a drink or two at major events? What kind impact does that really have? The fitness industryâs anti-alcohol stance is due, in large part, to the (lack of) nutritional content contained in alcoholic beverages. Ethanol, the type of alcohol found in drinks, has toxic metabolic byproducts called acetaldehyde and acetate.
A report by the Mayo Clinic indicates that proper nutrition can boost any exercise routine and affect performance and feelings of well-being while exercising. The best kinds of nutrition depend on the results that a person is seeking and the type of exercise being performed.
Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do for your health. Fitting regular exercise into your daily schedule may seem difficult at first. But even ten minutes at a time is fine. The key is to find the right exercise for you. It should be fun and should match your abilities.

Pressey agreed to a non-guaranteed deal Tuesday with the Warriors that includes an invite to training camp, international basketball writer David Pick reports. Pressey spent time last season with the 76ers and Suns, appearing in 23 total games and averaging 3.4 points and 3.3 assists per game. The 25-year-old also appeared in 31 games for the Idaho Stampede of the D-League, posting averages of 13.7 points, 6.8 assists and 4.5 rebounds per game. Pressey's chances of cracking the Warriors' final 15-man roster out of camp appear slim at this juncture.

The use of literally as an intensifier is common, esp in informal contexts. In some cases, it provides emphasis without adding to the meaning: the house was literally only five minutes walk away. Often, however, its use results in absurdity: the news was literally an eye-opener to me.
In many cases, the people there are fighting, in a literal sense, for their homes. 2. adjective. A literal translation is one in which you translate each word of the original work rather than giving the meaning of each expression or sentence using words that sound natural. A literal translation of the name Tapies is walls..
Figurative language can include things like metaphors and similes. In other words, we tend to use 'off the chain' in ways that have nothing to do with the literal meanings of off ('detached from') and chain ('tether typically constructed of interconnecting metal links').
Since the early 19th century, literally has been widely used as an intensifier meaning âin effect, virtually,â a sense that contradicts the earlier meaning âactually, without exaggerationâ: The senator was literally buried alive in the Iowa primaries. The parties were literally trading horses in an effort to reach a compromise.
Rather than assign physical gestures based on the literal meaning of a person's spoken words, the program focuses on prosody, the combination of vocal rhythm, intonation and stress.

Literal language refers to the use of words solely by their defined or primary meanings. It is contrasted with figurative language, which identifies the use of words in figures of speech to convey meanings different from their usual definitions.
Examples of literally in a sentence. â¦ 1  make the whole scene literally glow with the fires of his imagination. 2  Even Muff did not miss our periods of companionship, because about that time she grew up and started having literally millions of kittens. 3  Lily, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet.
In the case of your friend's fugitive pet, the literal usage of 'off the chain' probably wasn't the best choice of words. That's because this phrase is typically employed as figurative language, which identifies the use of words in figures of speech to convey meanings different from their usual definitions.
Codependent behavior damages relationships. Codependency is an excessive emotional, physical, and psychological reliance upon a relationship that is dysfunctional. It is an emotional condition that can destroy a personâs happiness, career, health and personal relationships.
Ten Characteristics of Those with Codependent Behavior. 1  Feeling responsible for solving othersâ problems: The codependent feels the need to solve anotherâs problems. The codependent believes that help is needed and that the person in need cannot manage to make the right decisions or take the right actions to solve his or her own problems.
In 1988, psychiatrist Timmen Cermak suggested that codependency is a disease noting the addictive process. Psychiatrist and doctor of internal medicine, Charles Whitfield , described codependence as a chronic and progressive disease of âlost-selfhoodâ with recognizable, treatable symptoms â just like chemical dependence.
Stages of Codependency. Codependency is chronic with enduring symptoms that are also progressive, meaning that they worsen over time without intervention and treatment. In my opinion codependency begins in childhood due to a dysfunctional family environment.
You have probably heard the term âcodependencyâ used a lot, as it became a popular term in our vernacular sometime after the Alcoholics Anonymous twelve step recovery program was established in the late 1930s.
I agree with Dr. Whitfield, and in Codependency for Dummies refer to codependency as a disease of a lost self. In recovery, we recover our selves. Codependency is also characterized by symptoms that vary on a continuum similar to those associated with drug addiction.
Ten Characteristics of Those with Codependent Behavior. 1  Feeling responsible for solving othersâ problems: The codependent feels the need to solve anotherâs problems. 2  Offering advice to others whether it is asked for or not: The codependent jumps at the opportunity to provide much-needed advice.
Codependent people have a greater tendency than others to get involved in unhealthy or toxic relationships.. This is when a partner is unreliable, emotionally unavailable or unstable, or overly needy/clingly. If you are a codependent person, you may repeatedly enter relationships with these kinds of people.
Co-dependency is a learned behavior that can be passed down from one generation to another. It is an. emotional and behavioral condition that affects an individualâs ability to have a healthy, mutually satisfying. relationship. It is also known as ârelationship addictionâ because people with codependency often form or. maintain relationships that are one-sided, emotionally destructive and/or abusive.
Oftentimes, a part of being codependent is a resistance to being able to HAVE FUN AND PLAY! So part of recovery from codependency is learning how to let go and have fun. Therefore it's bound to be liberating, and fun as we learn how to let go and play. back to top of questions.
This system did not supply enough workers as the tobacco farms became sugar plantations. Sugar needed a large number of workers. The Portuguese had been using enslaved Africans to grow sugar in the Madeira Islands (in the north Atlantic Ocean) since about 1460. Africa was closer to the Caribbean than Europe was.
The Spanish and Portuguese first began sugar cultivation on plantations on the Atlantic islands â the Canaries, Cape Verde and Madeira â then on SÃ£o TomÃ© and Principe in the Gulf of Guinea.
Sugar has been produced since and is the worldâs most popular sweetener. Climate. Sugar crystals were first produced centuries ago from sugarcane, a plant which grows best in warm temperate or tropical regions. Approximately 100 countries located within the tropics now grow sugarcane.
Health and Nutrition. Crystalline sucrose sugar is a carbohydrate, and moderate sugar intake can be part of a healthy diet. Sugar not only sweetens food and beverages, but also provides users with an instant jolt of energy. Humans should derive 50 to 55 percent of their daily energy consumption from carbohydrates. Brazilian Sugar. The Portuguese first planted sugarcane in Brazil during the 1530s. Since then, sugar has been an integral part of Brazilâs social, political and economic history.
From there, the Spanish developed sugar plantations in Jamaica and Puerto Rico. But sugar plantations really took off in Brazil under the Portuguese and Dutch, the cane initially being transplanted from Madeira in the 1540s. Two decades later, Brazil was producing 2,500 tons of sugar a year. The rise of the Brazilian sugar industry in the 16th century confirmed the importance of the plantation.
The controversy over slavery in the sugar colonies was vigorously pursued in Parliament and in publication throughout the last quarter of the eighteenth century and up to the time of abolition of the trade in 1807 and emancipation in 1833.
Slaves toiled in the fields and the boiling houses, supplying the huge amounts of labor that sugar required. Overall some four million slaves were brought to the Caribbean, and almost all ended up on the sugar plantations.
The Portuguese in Brazil. When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil in 1500, their situation as colonialists was very different from that of Spain in Mexico and Peru. They did not find an advanced civilisation with hoards of precious metals for plunder, or a social discipline and organisation geared to provide steady tribute which they could appropriate.
Manufactured goods were traded to the West African coast for slaves, who were shipped to the sugar colonies (the infamous middle passage) and sugar, molasses, and rum were shipped from the islands to England. Slavery in England itself had been deemed illegal since 1772.
The development of the plantation system. The Europeans settled in the Caribbean and on mainland America. The Spanish settled Jamaica, Cuba and Hispaniola, amongst other islands. In 1607 the English established a colony on the east coast of America, named Virginia. In 1623 and 1625, they settled the islands of St Kitts and Barbados in the Caribbean.
Come to Belize and youâll hear familiar words of the English language. In fact, we are the only English language-speaking country in Central America. While English is the official language of Belize, Kriol is the language that we all speak. When you hear us, you know youâre in a country unlike any other. Even our most up-tight citizens sound relaxed.
One of the themes of Speak is isolation. Losing her friends is not the main cause of Melinda's sense of isolation, however. Melinda was raped at the party by a boy named Andy Evans. After the rape, Melinda is unable to speak about what happened to her and quits speaking altogether. Rape and the consequences for the victim is the main theme, along with losing one's voice and the tremendous courage it takes to find it again.
As previously mentioned, one of the features of the Central American speaking style is the voseo: the usage of the pronoun vos for the second person singular, instead of tÃº.

Belize is located in Central America and it is bordered to the north by Mexico, to the south and west by Guatemala and to the east by the Caribbean Sea. We are a diverse country with various cultures and languages.
Central American Spanish (Spanish: espaÃ±ol centroamericano or castellano centroamericano) is the general name of the Spanish language dialects spoken in Central America. More precisely, the term refers to the Spanish language as spoken in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.

In a lot of ways, Office 365 is what Windows Live shouldâve been. As part of Microsoftâs push for Office 365, they released a collection of web apps called Outlook on the web (formerly Outlook Web App) in 2015. This suite included four separate tools: Outlook Mail, Outlook Calendar, Outlook People, and Outlook Tasks.
Hereâs where it starts to get confusing. As part of this movement, Microsoft planned to phase out Hotmail and replace it with a new mail system called Windows Live Mail. But when beta testers complained about the change and how they preferred the Hotmail brand, Microsoft backtracked and settled on Windows Live Hotmail.
Remember how Microsoft wanted to rebrand Hotmail as Windows Live Mail? This has nothing to do with that. Hotmail became Windows Live Hotmail while Windows Mail became Windows Live Mail. On Windows 10, none of the above-mentioned programs are relevant except for Outlook (which can also be called Office Outlook if you want to differentiate it from all the other Outlook-related products out there).

PHP programs can be created using any text editor such as EditRocket. PHP programs and scripts typically end with the .php extension. EditRocket will automatically recognize files with the .php extension as PHP programs, and will color the syntax accordingly.
When you create your own PHP-CPP extension, you also have to compile and deploy it. A normal PHP script only has to be copied to a web server to be deployed, but it takes a little more effort to deploy an extension: you need a Makefile, an extension specific php.ini file and of course the *.cpp files in which you implement your extension.
Based on this extension name, the # name of the library file (name.so) and the name of the config file (name.ini) # are automatically generated # NAME = yourextension # # Php.ini directories # # In the past, PHP used a single php.ini configuration file.
PHP code may be embedded into HTML or HTML5 markup, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server software combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page.
The above program can be executed using the EditRocket Tools -> PHP -> Execute Program option, or you can execute it from a command prompt. To execute the script in the command prompt, use the cd command to cd to the directory where the hello.php file was saved, such as. cd C:\Scripts.

What are file extensions. A file extension, or file name extension, is the letters immediately shown after the last period in a file name. For example, the file extension.txt has an extension of .txt. This extension allows the operating system to know what type of file it is and what program to run when you double-click on it.

Insertion of a Coude CoudÃ©. Catheter The coude, coudÃ© catheter which has a stiffer and, pointed tip was designed to overcome urethral obstruction that a more flexible catheter (cannot, negotiate eg in patients with benign). prostatic hypertrophy
By Chass Armstrong. If you have ever wondered what the difference between a straight tip catheter and coude tip catheter are, you have come to the right place. In this blog we will help to clear up the differences and what the specific uses for each catheter are.
When the catheter tip is in the balloon, the wire can be removed, and the balloon should drain. If the above techniques are unsuccessful, 10 mL of mineral oil may be injected through the inflation port and will dissolve the balloon within 15 minutes. If this does not occur, an additional 10 mL can be instilled.
Selecting a Catheter. 1  The Foley catheter is used in almost all cases when an indwelling urinary catheter is required. 2  For routine, short-term catheterization in males or females, a 14F or 18F rubber catheter with a 10-mL balloon is satisfactory. 3  Men with prostatic hypertrophy may require larger catheters (eg, 20-22F).
Contraindications. 1  The following are only relative contraindications to insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter: 2  Previous urethral surgery. 3  Suspected or known urethra trauma (free-floating prostate, blood issuing from urethra meatus). 4  In this case, perform a urethrogram before urethral catheterization is attempted.
1 Open the catheter/dressing tray and selected catheter, and position them on a sterile field placed on a bedside table or stand so that all required materials are readily accessible. 2  Place a generous amount of lubricant on the sterile field. 3  Put on sterile gloves, and drape the perineal area.
Selecting a Catheter. 1  The Foley catheter is used in almost all cases when an indwelling urinary catheter is required. 2  It consists of a double-lumen rubber tube with a terminal retaining balloon. 3  The larger channel is for drainage of urine, and the smaller is for inflation of the balloon.

People sometimes supplemented their diet by hunting and fowling and by gathering wild fruit and roots. In the Tale of Sinuhe the protagonist, who had become a tribal chief, recounts: Loaves were made for me daily, and wine as daily fare, cooked meat, roast fowl, as well as desert game.
Mustard, any of several herbs belonging to the mustard family of plants, Brassicaceae (Cruciferae), or the condiment made from these plantsâ pungent seeds. The leaves and swollen leaf stems of mustard plants are also used, as greens, or potherbs.
By some accounts, mustard was the first condiment humans ever put on their food. Egyptian pharaohs stocked their tombs with mustard seeds to accompany them into the afterlife, but the Romans were the first to grind the spicy seeds into a spreadable paste and mix them with a flavorful liquidâusually, wine or vinegar.
The origins of mustard. The mustard grain has been known since ancient times, it was cultivated by the Chinese more than 3000 years ago! It has been a part of the most ancient Mediterranean civilisations. The Egyptians, Greeks and Romans used it to spice up meat and fish dishes. They crushed the grains and mixed it into their food.
First things first: âmustardâ is a plant; âprepared mustardâ is a condiment. Although itâs rarely necessary to specify âpreparedâ mustard when referring to the spicy spread, it only seems fair to acknowledge mustardâs true roots. 2. Broccoli is a not-so-distant cousin.
While the food of the common people was barely adequate at best, and during the recurring corn dearths sadly lacking, the affluent certainly knew how to live it up: Meat, water fowls, vegetables, fruit and wine were part of their diet, as was the ubiquitous bread in one of its many guises.
Pythagoras endorsed a poultice of mustard seeds as a cure for scorpion stings. Hippocrates praised mustard paste as a miracle remedy capable of soothing pains and aches; and ancient Roman physicians used it to ease toothaches. They werenât alone.
The use of mustard seeds as a spice has been known from the earliest recorded times and is described in Indian and Sumerian texts dating back to 3000 bce. Mustard plants are mentioned frequently in Greek and Roman writings and in the Bible.
History of abortion. Indirect advertisements for abortion services, like these in The New York Sun in 1842, were common during the Victorian era. At the time, abortion was illegal in New York. The practice of abortionâthe termination of a pregnancyâhas been known since ancient times. Various methods have been used to perform an abortion, including the administration of abortifacient herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques.
[3] Mustard was used in ancient medicine: the Romans mixed it with vinegar to resuscitate people who had suffered a fit. There are three different kinds of mustard, the first of a thin, slender form, the second, with a leaf like that of the rape, and the third, with that of rocket: the best seed comes from Egypt.

Constitutional Convention. The Constitution was written during the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by 55 delegates to a Constitutional Convention that was called ostensibly to amend the Articles of Confederation (1781â89), the countryâs first written constitution.
The Constitution of the United States, written to redress the deficiencies of the countryâs first constitution, the Articles of Confederation (1781â89), defines a federal system of government in which certain powers are delegated to the national government and others are reserved to the states. The nationalâ¦
Their work, written under the pseudonym âPubliusâ and collected and published in book form as The Federalist (1788), became a classic exposition and defense of the Constitution. In June 1788, after the Constitution had been ratified by nine states (as required by Article VII), Congress set March 4, 1789, as the date for the new government to commence proceedings (the first elections under the Constitution were held late in 1788).
Constitution of the United States of America, the fundamental law of the U.S. federal system of government and a landmark document of the Western world. The oldest written national constitution in use, the Constitution defines the principal organs of government and their jurisdictions and the basic rights of citizens.
The political power of the slave states meant that the nation was always forced to protect slavery. Thus the South in effect controlled politics from 1788 until 1861. Slave owners held the presidency for all but 12 years between 1788 and 1850.
State Constitutions. James Wilson signed the Declaration of Independence and was the Advocate General for France in America from 1779 to 1783. The states now faced serious and complicated questions about how to make their rules.
The first and most obvious change involves slavery. The 13th Amendment was possible (as were the other two Civil War amendments) only because the war broke slaveryâs stranglehold over politics and constitutional development. The Constitution of 1787 protected slavery at every turn.

Know the Incentive Types. Before you learn how to use car incentives and rebates, you must first know what they are. Here is a quick rundown: Customer Cash: Customer cash, also called bonus cash, is a rebate the manufacturer gives to the consumer.
So if you lease the car for 3 years, you are paying for the difference between what the car is worth today vs what the car will be worth in 3 years. So say the car is worth $40K today, but 3 years from now, the lease company believes the car will only be worth $18K.
This is how rent-to-buy works: for a set period of time, usually 54 months, you will pay a fixed amount to rent a car. By paying this monthly rental fee you will in fact be paying monthly instalments on your car. During this time youâll have full access to the car and wonât be limited by a maximum monthly mileage.
Small used car sellers offer lease-to-own or rent-to-own programs to people who cannot qualify to purchase cars from dealers that have tougher requirements for credit history and employment. Lease-to-own agreements differ from the standard vehicle lease agreements offered by automobile dealers.
Before you learn how to use car incentives and rebates, you must first know what they are. Customer Cash: Customer cash, also called bonus cash, is a rebate the manufacturer gives to the consumer. The buyer typically applies it to the price of the vehicle, but buyers can sometimes opt to keep the money for themselves.
If you have decided to get a vehicle, you probably know you have two basic options: to lease a car or to buy one. There are advantages and disadvantages to each option, but leasing can be a solution if you don't have the credit or the money to buy a vehicle right away. Leasing is essentially a form of long-term rental.
Leasing a vehicle basically means you borrow the vehicle from the dealership for a fixed amount to pay every month you lease it. The most common lease I believe is 3 years. You also have a certain amount of miles you have to stay under for the time you are leasing the car.
When you lease a car, you are basically paying for the right to use a car for a time period, usually for three years. After that time, you simply return the car, trading it in for a different model or year.
The lease department jobber sets the monthly lease payments which are the difference between the dealer's cost to purchase the car and the value of the vehicle after the lease term is up. So, if the lease term was for three years, the vehicle will be worth a lot less after that time.
Buying a new car can be difficult for most people. Getting car finance from a traditional finance institution, such as a bank, becomes even more difficult for those with poor credit ratings and those who have been blacklisted. And then, if finance is granted the repayment terms could prove to be difficult.

How to Determine the Value of your Baseball Cards. Determining the value of a baseball card is the first thing you'll want to do if you're planning on selling or buying one. The value of a baseball card is based on how much somebody is willing to pay for it. How much they're willing to pay for it is based on how rare the card is and the condition that the card is in.

A recent NICHD-supported study found that a common type of medication, sometimes given to infants for acid reflux and called âH2-blockers,â was associated with a slight increase in the risk of NEC in preterm infants.
Signs and symptoms[edit] The condition is typically seen in premature infants, and the timing of its onset is generally inversely proportional to the gestational age of the baby at birth (i.e. the earlier a baby is born, the later signs of NEC are typically seen).
1 Inability of the infantâs digestive system to keep out dangerous bacteria.  Inadequate ability of the immature intestine to provide an adequate structural barrier to bacteria. This barrier usually matures in the unborn infant starting about week 26 (11 to 12 weeks before a full-term birth).
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious illness in newborns. It happens when tissue in the large intestine (colon) gets inflamed. This inflammation damages and sometimes kills the tissue in your babyâs colon. Any newborn can get NEC. But itâs most common in premature babies.
It occurs postnatally (i.e. it is not seen in stillborn infants) and is the second most common cause of morbidity in premature infants, causing 355 deaths per year in the United States in 2013, down from 484 in 2009. Rates per 100,000 live births were almost three times higher for blacks than for whites.
Babies who had a difficult birth or low oxygen levels at birth are more likely to get NEC. When there is too little oxygen, the body sends blood and oxygen to the brain and heart first. This reduces the blood flow to the intestinal tract. This can cause less oxygen in blood to reach the colon.
Full-term infants are usually diagnosed with NEC earlier than are premature infants (day 5 versus day 13 on average), possibly because they start feeding earlier. The condition is equally life threatening in premature and full-term infants.
No one knows what causes NEC. It may happen if not enough blood and oxygen reach your babyâs intestinal tissues. Then when food moves into the area, bacteria from the food can damage the tender tissues. This can harm the tissues and cause them to die. When this happens, a hole forms in the intestine. This can cause a severe infection in your babyâs belly (abdomen).
Autopsy of infant showing abdominal distension, intestinal necrosis and hemorrhage, and peritonitis due to perforation. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a medical condition primarily seen in premature infants, where portions of the bowel undergo necrosis (tissue death).
In premature infants, the cause may be related to the immaturity of the childâs digestive system. NEC involves infection and inflammation in the childâs gut, which may stem from the growth of dangerous bacteria or the growth of bacteria in parts of the intestine where they do not usually live.
At least on one occasion, a resolution seeking the impeachment of a Supreme Court Justice was introduced in response to a direct judicial act. Representative W. M. Wheeler (D-Ga.) introduced the resolution after Justice Douglas stayed the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on June 17, 1953.
Under the authoritative construction by the highest court of impeachment, the Senate of the United States, a high misdemeanor for which a judge may be removed is misconduct involving bad faith or wantoness [sic] or recklessness in his judicial actions, or in the use of his official influence for ulterior purposes.

They tried again in 1860, and again the House Judiciary Committee voted out articles of impeachment. However, Texas had seceded from the Union by this time and the House never got around to it by the time it expired on March 4, 1861.
The Senate considered the articles of impeachment on April 23, 1926, and the impeachment trial began with Judge English's answer to the articles on May 3, 1926.

Scientific literacy also implies the capacity to pose and evaluate arguments based on evidence and to apply conclusions from such arguments appropriately.
Literacy is defined by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, as [the ability of] a person aged 7 years and above [to]... both write and read with understanding in any language.. According to the 2011 census, 74.04 percent of the population of India is literate.
Numeracy, like language and literacy, is essential to doing science. The skills of sorting and classifying, estimating and counting, measuring, graphing, collecting data and analyzing are frequently used when doing science.
The inability to do so is called illiteracy or analphabetism. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines literacy as the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts.
The key to literacy is reading development, a progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and culminates in the deep understanding of text.
The use of literacy skills while learning science content extends and expands their] scientific reasoning (Hapgood & Palincsar, 2007).A growing body of research and practice in science instruction indicates language is essential for science learning.
Once these skills are acquired, the reader can attain full language literacy, which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis, inference and synthesis; to write with accuracy and coherence; and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought.
Why is Science Literacy so Important? Science, technology and innovation are increasingly important to our economic well-being and quality of life. At Letâs Talk Science, we define âscience literacyâ broadly to include science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Science literacy helps us understand and shape our daily lives. It helps us as we interact with our environment, asking questions and seeking answers.
The National Science Education Standards' definition of science literacy also emphasizes the link between science knowledge and literacy skills. Scientific literacy means that a person can ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences.
Scientific literacy is the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity. It also includes specific types of abilities. In the National Science Education Standards, the content standards define scientific literacy. Scientific literacy means that a person can ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences. It means that a person has the ability to describe, explain, and predict natural phenomena.
The thickness of a cell membrane is now stated to be from three to ten nanometers based on the advanced technology of today. With the electron microscope, the cell membrane is seen as a continuous, thin double line with globular proteins embedded throughout. Jennifer Shloming -- 2001.

What impacts do humans have on the ocean? Our impacts on the oceans are vast: we take food, minerals, sand and more, in huge quantities, all the while pouring waste and toxins in. There is now nowhere on the planet that is untouched by human activities, and 40% of the oceans are heavily affected: our ocean is dying.
Conservation needs to be done by humans to prevent damage to the world caused by humans. But what humans donât think about is how without conservation our lives will change. Resources, such as water, oil, natural gas, wood and food, become less available as we donât protect our planet.
The ocean floor habitat is not as. well known as coral reefs or coastal. areas, but it is very important to all. the organisms that live on the bottom. (benthic organisms), as well as. commercially important as well.
Conservation means a lot to me because without it ecosystems would fall apart and animals will become extinct. People often care about cute big animals like monkeys, tigers and eagles but it is just as important to look after animals that are not cute as well, like jellyfish, wasps and cod. Conservation is not just important for animals but to all living things. Conservation is also very important to prevent floods, fires, new deserts and drought. It is important to protect habitats and natural areas like rainforests. If we allow the destruction of rainforests it will increase the production of greenhouse gases which make the world warm up.
Marine conservation technologies are used to protect endangered and threatened marine organisms and/or habitat. These technologies are innovative and revolutionary because they reduce bycatch, increase the survivorship and health of marine life and habitat, and benefit fishermen who depend on the resources for profit.
Marine resources conservation also known as marine conservation, is the protection and preservation of ecosystems in oceans and seas. Marine resources conservation focuses on limiting human-caused damage to marine ecosystems, restoring damaged marine ecosystems, and preserving vulnerable marine species.

Science vs Common Sense. Saxophones are mostly made from brass, which is an alloy mostly of copper and zinc. There are and have been slightly different combinations, and various other metals (e.g. lead) also included. Saxophones are also made from other materials, e.g. copper, bronze, silver and plastic. Various finishes are available: different types of lacquer and metal plating, e.g. silver, gold and nickel.
Pros of buying a used saxophone: A used saxophone is the most cost-effective option. With literally thousands of choices, a used horn can usually be found in your desired quality and price range. Also, the materials and craftsmanship of older used horns is usually superb.
Raw Materials. Saxophones are primarily made from brass. Brass is a composite alloy made up of metals including copper, tin, nickel, and zinc. The most common type used for instruments is yellow brass which contains 70% copper and 30% zinc. Other types include gold brass and silver brass which have different ratios.
Other materials are used to make the saxophone. Most of the screws are composed of stainless steel. Cork is used to line the joints and water keys. In some cases, a wax is applied to these joints. Mouthpieces can be made from various materials, however, the material has little effect on the sound.
This is a big decision when it comes to buying a saxophone. A lot of newcomers to the instrument don't even think about used saxophones as an option. If you are on a limited budget, or are not afraid of the research and legwork involved with a used saxophone, that may be the way to go.

A modular home is one that is built indoors in a factory-like setting. The finished products are covered and transported to their new locations, where they are assembled by a builder. A modular home is not a mobile home; it is simply a home that is built off-site, as opposed to on-site. These homes are often called factory-built, system-built or prefab (short for prefabricated) homes. Modular and manufactured homes are not the same. Manufactured homes are not placed on permanent foundations.
With stick built homes, your home is built on your lot, so there is no need to worry about what could happen to your home during transportation. A stick built home also offers higher quality construction because your home is built board-by-board and brick-by-brick on your lot.
The cost of constructing a modular house runs about 10 to 20 percent less than stick-built housing. Putting up a modular house takes far less time than the stick-built version. With a modular home, all parts are pre-cut, pre-cast and ready for assembly.
Building Codes: Modular & Stick Built: Modular houses and stick-built meet the same building codes. The difference with Martell Home Builders is that we do BOTH types of construction and can advise you on what is best for your individual needs and situation.
1 Insurance premiums for modular homes are the same as site-built homes. 2  Taxes on modular homes are the same as site-built homes. 3  Modular homes can be built to withstand 175-mph winds.  Modular homes can be built for accessible living and designed for future conveniences.
Your modular home might come in a kit, with the price varying according to the size and the manufacturer. Kits range from $14,000 for very basic housing to $100,000 or more for customized, higher-quality units. Modular houses must meet the same building codes as their stick-built cousins.
In some areas, there is still a bit of a stigma attached to a modular home, although that viewpoint is changing. Resale value might be similar to stick-built in parts of the country with a high percentage of modular home construction, such as the Southwest. While high-quality modular homes retain their value, lower-quality homes may depreciate faster than a stick-built counterpart.
Resale Value: Modular: Well built, high-quality modular homes retain their value well. Stick Built: Traditionally, constructed homes held their value better. But that is changing, now that modulars, like Martell Home Builderâs are of high standards.
Modern modular houses can be indistinguishable from traditional stick-built homes. They also cost less to construct than the stick-built variety, so-called because they are built out of lumber, or sticks.. Modular house prices are generally lower than stick-built houses, often considerably so.
Modular & Stick Built: The same cost when comparing âlikeâ materials. Modular: Well built, high-quality modular homes retain their value well.

By gauging the last official population estimate and recent growth rates, we estimate that the population of Delaware is 955,900 in 2016. At the time of the 2010 Census, the population of Delaware was recorded at 897,934, which represented a 14.6% rise on the 2000 figure of 783,600. An estimate in 2015 claims that the population within the state had risen to 945,934, and this would make Delaware the 45th largest state in the USA as far as population.
Cost of living is attractive, and the Delaware tax climate is favorable especially for the East. However, there is a high violent crime rate, and educational attainment is not as strong as seen in other capital cities. Dover lies in a flat plain separated from the Delaware Bay but has areas of level marshland.
Estimates put the population of Delaware in 2020 right around 1 million based on current growth rates. By projecting the current growth rates out to 2020, we end up with an estimate of 995,764 for 2020, just shy of the 1 million total.
By the end of last year, 935,614 people called Delaware home, according to the new federal estimates, up 4.2 percent and the 16th highest rate among all states. Current projections put Delaware on track to break the 1 million-resident mark in less than a decade, by 2023, according to a separate state-level forecast.
In Delaware, Smyrna led the state with an 11.4 percent population increase, bucking a trend that generally saw Sussex County with the highest growth rates. In 2014, Smyrna's population was estimated at 10,900.

Most alcoholic beverages have high acidic levels and are damaging to tooth enamel. Wine, beer, and hard liquor all have a pH balance of around 4 and lower. Wine is more acidic than beer, with sweet wines being the most acidic. Alcohol can be especially damaging when paired with other acidic drinks, such as pop and fruit juices.
Titratable acidity should not be confused with total acidity: total acidity only quantifies the. molar weights of acids contained in a grape, must or wine; TA is an approximation of total. acidity by titration with a strong base (NAOH) to a pH of 8.2, i.e. TA is the sum of both acid.
Excess intake of beverages that are highly acidic can wear down tooth enamel and cause tooth decay. Unfortunately, many of our favorite drinks are highly acidic and can cause damage over time. Acid levels are measured on the pH scale, and the lower pH a drink has, the more acidic is. A neutral pH level is 7, and drinks that have under a 5.5 pH level can start to have negative effects on your teeth. Below is a list of the top most acidic drinks that you should avoid, and healthy alternatives that arenât damaging to your teeth. Soda pop is one of the most acidic drinks on the market.
Why is the acid-level important in winemaking? Low acidity (high pH), common in grapes that are too sweet because they were grown in excessively warm climates, lowers the amount of subtle flavours in the grapes and consequently in the wine. As mentioned before, there is an optimum pH for fermentation as well.
Pasteur realized that yeast was responsible for the conversion of glucose to alcohol. By adding yeast to a simple sugar solution, he showed that alcohol could be formed. He also revealed that the metabolism of yeast was pH -dependent; the acid-level played a role in determining wine's properties. One of grapes' two principal acids, tartaric acid (malic acid is the other), led to Pasteur's discovery of enantiomers, molecules that are mirror images of one another.
Please note the following in the Common Beverages Substitutions Chart: 1. Only the pH is provided. Calorie, sugar content and other information is not provided.. 2. Beer and wine are represented, but there are differences among the various brews and wines. In general, red wine is less acidic than white wine. 3. Spirits and liquors are not listed. Almost invariably, they are acidic. Acidity will vary, meaning the pH will vary among the different spirits and liquors and will also vary depending on the flavoring (as one sees, for example, in vodkas).
Acidic fluids have a pH less than 7.0. The lower the pH, the more acidic the beverage. In terms of flavor, more acidity means more sourness. The actual sensation of the beverage's acidity may be modified by the sugar content. Acidic fluids are found in relishes, chutneys, salsas, marinades, dressings, sauces - you name it.
What role does temperature play in wine-making. Fermentation is an exothermic process ( it releases heat). But in wine-making, the temperature cannot exceed 85 F = 29.4 C for red wines or 60 F = 15.3 C for white wines), otherwise the growth of yeast cells will stop.
The typical acidity measurements in grape juice and wine are pH and titratable acidity (TA). The. pH measurement is used in the vineyard to assess the ripening pre-harvest, e.g., (Brix * pH2 ), to. calculate sulfur dioxide requirements after fermentation, and to assess oxidation risk because.
Translation: the difference between. a wine with a pH of 4.0 and with a pH of 3.0 is that the wine with the pH of 3.0 has 10x the. number of hydrogen ions as the pH 4.0 wine (or 1x10-3 versus 1x10-4 H+ ions). The. measurement of acidic content is the acidâs potential to liberate H+ ions as it dissociates.
1 This is because the extra chromosome 21 material is located on a different chromosome (the translocated one). 2  A carrier will have the extra material but will have only one chromosome 21. 3  The carrier will not exhibit any of the symptoms of Down syndrome because they have the correct amount of genetic material.
Symptoms. Each person with Down syndrome is an individual â intellectual and developmental problems range from mild to moderate, and some people are healthy while others have severe health problems such as serious heart defects. Children with Down syndrome have a distinct facial appearance. Though not all children with Down syndrome have the same features, some of the more common features are: 1  Flattened facial features. 2  Small head. 3  Short neck. 4  Protruding tongue. 5  Upward slanting eyes, unusual for the child's ethnic group. 6  Unusually shaped or small ears.
Yes, you can see the characteristics of Down Syndrome as well, but the family resemblence is remarkable. The 13 physical characteristics of Down Syndrome did NOT stop him from looking like the rest of us. Just in case: Down Syndrome picture is the 2nd from the left in the top row. Many of the 13 characteristics of Down Syndrome can be seen, but the physical characteristics of Down Syndrome are insignificant to the beholder.
1 Trisomy 21 â More than 90% of Down syndrome cases are caused by trisomy 21. 2  An extra chromosome (chromosome 21) originates in the development of either the sperm or the egg. 3  When the egg and the sperm unite to form the fertilized egg, three (rather than two) chromosomes 21 are present.
People have come to associate a certain hair style as a physical characteristic of Down Syndrome, but hair style is a very modifiable characteristic. By modifying this characteristic of Down Syndrome, hair style, their appearance is seen as more normal.
The 13 characteristics of Down Syndrome are still there, but they DONâT tend to be the characteristics of Down Syndrome that people associate with Down Syndrome people! Down Syndrome phenotypic features are normally relatively unimportant in the look of a kid with Down Syndrome.
People with Down's syndrome often have certain physical characteristics. Not everyone will have all of them, but they may include: 1  reduced muscle tone which results in floppiness (hypotonia). 2  a small nose and flat nasal bridge. 3  a small mouth with a protruding tongue. 4  eyes that slant upwards and outwards. 5  a flat back of the head. 6  a big space ....
Each person with Down's syndrome is affected differently, but most share a number of physical characteristics and developmental problems.
2â¦ Hair Style is also characteristic of Down Syndrome. Another big determiner of a Down Syndrome characteristic appearance, believe it or not, appears to be the hair style! One lady, talking sarcastically, made a flippant comment how every person with Down Syndrome she saw in Canada had the bowl style hair cut.
1 Mosaic Trisomy 21 â This is a rare form (less than 2% of cases) of Down syndrome. 2  While similar to simple trisomy 21, the difference is that the extra chromosome 21 is present in some, but not all cells, of the individual. 3  This type of Down syndrome is caused by abnormal cell division after fertilization.

Is there a different name that CSA used for the battle? [Most Civil War battles have two names â one the North used and one the South used] The battle is known as the Battle of Bull Run, or sometimes the First Battle of Bull Run as there were two battles in the same area. In the CSA it was known as the Battle of Manassas or Frist Battle of Manassas. 2) What were the events that lead to the battle? In other words how did the course of the war lead to this battle?
The reason for the Second battle of Manassas was given by Lee's decision to strike the Union Army of Virginia, commanded by Gen. John Pope, before it could be joined by McClel â¦ lan's Federal Army of the Potomac..
In July of 1861 a sizeable Confederate force under the command of General Beauregard was stationed just 25 miles from Washington D.C. at Masnassas Junction. The newspapers and the public were calling for action soon, but Union General Irvin McDowell knew his army was not prepared yet for battle.
Located north of Manassas, in Prince William County, Virginia, it preserves the site of two major American Civil War battles: the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, and the Second Battle of Bull Run which was fought between August 28 and August 30, 1862 (also known as the First Battle of Manassas and the Second Battle of Manassas, respectively).
The Confederates won a decisive victory in the Second Battle of Manassas (also called Second Bull Run). Pope hammered against Jackson's Corps, which was well-entrenched in a gâ¦ood defensive position. Completely unknown to Pope, Longstreet's Corps came up and took position on Pope's flank.
Where did the Second Battle of Panipat take place? The Second Battle of Panipat took place at Panipat in Haryana, India, on 5th Nov 1556 between Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya, popularly known as Hemu and the Mughal army of A â¦ kbar.
It took place on the same ground as the First Battle of Bull Run. The battles took place around the city of Manassas, which is in Prince William County, Virginia. These battlâ¦es are also known as the First and Second Manassas.
The battle of Chickamauga took place on September 19-20, and was the second most deadly battle of the Civil War. The Confederate leader was named Braxton Bragg, and the union â¦leaders were George Thomas and William Rosecrans.   On September 18-20, 1863 in Catoosa County and Walker County, Georgia.

Sally was runner-up to the world title in 2010, 2011 and 2012, and has won several World Championship Tour events including the Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach in 2011 and 2012, the 2011 US Open and 2012 Australian Open, the 2013 Roxy Pro France and the 2014 Billabong Rio Pro and Fiji Pro.
Trent began his football career as a Dragons player and made his first grade debut in 2009. He then went on to win the grand finals for the team in 2010. Sally is equally as talented, having won a long list of competitions since the age of 14.
You'd be grinning too, if you'd just moved into the number one position on the ASP's World Championship Tour rankings. With three events to come after this week's Swatch Women's Pro at Trestles the job is far from over, and Sally is going to fight hard to keep the lead, until the year's end.
So it's finally been confirmed-Sally Fitzgibbons and Trent Merrin are boyfriend an item. The much-speculated romance between the Aussie sport stars was officially revealed on Friday. The announcement follows the pair's romantic rendezvous in Victoria where the surf chick competed at Bells Beach last month.
In February, 2012, Fitzgibbons won the first ever Australian Open after defeating 2004 World Champion Sofia Mulanovich, this meant Sally will be the first person to ever hold the US and Australian Opens of Surf titles at the one time. On 23 February 2012, at the 2012 ASP World Surfing Awards Sally won three awards. First was for being runner up in the 2011 World Tour. Second was for Sally Fitzgibbons and Carissa Moore for winning the Women's ASP Heat of the Year as voted on by their fellow competitors.

Biological hazards reports. The European Union system for the monitoring and collection of information on zoonoses is based on Directive 2003/99/EC, which obliges the Member States of the European Union (EU) to collect data on the occurrence of zoonoses, zoonotic agents, antimicrobial resistance, animal populations and food-borne outbreaks.
About the WHO department Food Safety and Zoonoses. The WHO department of Food Safety and Zoonoses (FOS) provides leadership in global efforts to lower the burden of diseases, thereby strengthening the health security and ensuring sustainable development of Member States. Overview of the FOS department.
This report was prepared by the Microbiology Sub-committee and adopted by the ScientificCommittee. for presentation to the FSAI. It aims to provide the FSAI and other stakeholders with an overview of. the science and related issues surrounding the potential for transmission of zoonotic tuberculosis. via food. Fo o d Sa F e t y au t h o r i t y o F ir e l a n d. . On the basis of available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the occurrence of viable M. bovis. in the muscle mass of cattle, and of other food-producing animals infected with M. bovis, is uncommon.

Food safety. Women are drivers of sustainable development. Food safety is essential to good nutrition and health, which are vital to sustainable development. WHO estimates that every year, 1 in 10 people fall ill and 125,000 children under 5 years of age die from foodborne diseases.
Food-borne zoonotic diseases are caused by consuming food or drinking water contaminated by pathogenic (disease-causing) micro-organisms such as bacteria and their toxins, viruses and parasites. They enter the body through the gastrointestinal tract where the first symptoms often occur.
Controlling zoonotic agents in animal and poultry reservoirs has the effect of. reducing the challenge to food safety management systems in processing and. further along the food chain. Producing and maintaining healthy stock requires. good husbandry practices, which include stock selection and veterinary. attention.
Ensuring that food is safe from the hazard of zoonotic. agents requires controls along the entire continuum from. farm to fork. To reduce the challenge to food safety. management systems further along the food chain, it is. important that everything that is reasonable, practical and.
Food-borne zoonotic diseases. Zoonoses are infections or diseases that can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans, for instance by consuming contaminated foodstuffs or through contact with infected animals. The severity of these diseases in humans varies from mild symptoms to life-threatening conditions.
Zoonotic Diseases. Animals play an important role in the lives of humans, providing both psychological and physiological benefits. However interactions with animals can pose a risk for zoonoses, diseases of animals that can be transferred to humans, leading to infection and disease. Many zoonotic diseases, such as rabies or ringworm, have been around for hundreds of years.

Sacrifice is to be found throughout the Iliad. Greeks and Trojans alike sacrifice to the gods of Olympus. Sacrifice, in the Iliad, is conceived of both as offerings which are the gods just due, and a means of placating the wrath of an angry god.The former concept can be seen in Zeusâ arguments with his wife Hera.acrifice, in the Iliad, is conceived of both as offerings which are the gods just due, and a means of placating the wrath of an angry god.

His mother was the nymph Thetis, and his father, Peleus, was the king of the Myrmidons. Achillesâ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy.Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow.chilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father.
Homer's Iliad is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath is the central theme of the poem. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death.chilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father.
Hector is the mightiest warrior in the Trojan army. Although he meets his match in Achilles, he wreaks havoc on the Achaean army during Achillesâ period of absence. He leads the assault that finally penetrates the Achaean ramparts, he is the first and only Trojan to set fire to an Achaean ship, and he kills Patroclus.ut Agamemnonâs pride makes him more arrogant than Achilles. While Achillesâ pride flares up after it is injured, Agamemnon uses every opportunity to make others feel the effects of his. He always expects the largest portions of the plunder, even though he takes the fewest risks in battle.
But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.chilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father.
Agamemnon. Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and commander-in-chief of the Achaean army, resembles Achilles in some respects. Though not nearly as strong, he has a similarly hot temper and prideful streak.ut Agamemnonâs pride makes him more arrogant than Achilles. While Achillesâ pride flares up after it is injured, Agamemnon uses every opportunity to make others feel the effects of his. He always expects the largest portions of the plunder, even though he takes the fewest risks in battle.
The Iliad opens with the argument between Agamemnon and Achilles. Agamemnon was the supreme commander of the Achaean army at the siege of Troy and Achilles was the finest warrior in Agamemnon's army. Both men were proud and obstinate but the blame for their dispute clearly fell on Agamemnon.chilles was the son of King Peleus and the Nereid, Thetis. His birth was the result of the union between a mortal [Peleus] and an Immortal [Thetis], which made Achilles semi-divine.

Fearing for the life of King Priam, Zeus commanded his son Hermes to meet Priam on the plain and escort him to Achilles.

There is also a new method of finding out the sex that is gaining in popularity, it's called the Ramzi's Method or Ramzi's Readings. This uses ultrasound in early pregnancy, as early as six weeks pregnant, to be able to tell the gender of your baby based on locating the placenta. Most physicians don't offer this per se, but you can certainly ask about it.
Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) also can determine your baby's sex with a high degree of accuracy, but these more invasive tests are usually reserved for situations in which the baby may have a genetic disorder or chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome.
Women with a high risk of carrying a baby with a genetic disorder can now take a blood test to find out more. Non-invasive prenatal testing reduces the risk of miscarriage associated with diagnostic tests (ie, CVS or amniocentesis) and is extremely accurate.
No obvious evidence of a penis may lead to the assumption that the baby is a girl, but this is not 100% proof, so if youâre having an ultrasound to find out the gender of your baby, be sure to ask the technician how clearly he or she can see the babyâs genitals on the monitor.

When Can I Find the Sex of My Baby? Most expectant mothers are able to find out the sex of their baby during their ultrasound. This is normally at mid pregnancy between the 16th and 20th weeks. Of course the choice is usually the motherâs and the ultrasound technician can only tell if they have a clear view of the genitals.
You can also identify the gender of your baby using a urine test. This test is fairly new in the market and it is based on your urine to help predict the babyâs gender. The test is known as Intelligender and it can predict the gender of your baby as early as 10 weeks.
A by-product of these tests is that you can find out the sex of your baby. The blood tests involve a study of your baby's chromosones: if a Y chromosome is detected, the baby is a boy while if there is no Y chromosome, the baby is a girl. These tests can be carried out from 10 weeks gestation and are close to 100 per cent accurate.
Having ultrasound to find out your babyâs gender is a fairly straightforward and safe procedure, and many expectant parents want to know this before the baby is born. That way, they can settle on a name for the baby and start decorating the nursery for either a girl or a boy.
You must be having a boy.. Or: If you have morning sickness all day, it's definitely a girl.. Even stranger myths for predicting the baby's sex exist. One suggests that mommies-to-be hang their wedding ring from a strand of the father's hair over their belly.
According to these new rules, a truck driver can drive for a maximum of 11 continuous hours, in a 14-hour work day, after which they are required to take a mandatory rest period of 10 hours before getting behind the wheel of their truck again.
Moreover, a driver cannot accumulate more than 60 hours of on-duty time during 7 consecutive days or 70 hours during 8 consecutive days. It is important to keep in mind that this restriction applies to on-duty time, not driving time.
Media Contacts â+. New DOT Regulations Require Commercial Truckers to Hit the Breaks. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (DOT) recently issued a final rule that revises the hours-of-service (HOS) safety requirements for commercial truck drivers (HOS Rule).
In any seven-day period, the truck can be on the road for 60-77 hours, and in an eight-day period, the truck can be driven between 70-88 hours. If the truck and its driver have been off the road for two and a half days continuously, they then can start their week at zero hours.
What's The Maximum Amount of Driving Time. For Truck Drivers? Driver fatigue is the leading cause of trucking accidents, and in an attempt to reduce the number of these accidents, the FMCSR contain hours-of-service regulations that specifically dictate the maximum number of hours that a driver can spend going about his business.
The âhours of service' rule under Federal Law does limit the number of hours that any truck, driven by a single truck driver, can continuously be on the road. These rules were established in 1939 in order to reduce truck driver fatigue and to increase the safety of trucks on the roads.
The hours-of-service regulations focus on when and how long you are allowed to drive by placing. specific limits on the amount of time you drive your truck and how many total hours you can work. before you are no longer permitted to drive a commercial motor vehicle. You must follow three.
In setting out these rules, the regulations differentiate between driving time and on duty time.. Driving time refers to the actual amount of time a driver spends at the driving controls of a commercial motor vehicle in operation..
If you drive short distances in a truck that does not require a commercial driverâs license (CDL), you might be able to use the non-CDL short-haul exception. This short-haul exception allows you. to extend the 14-hour driving window to 16 hours on 2 days in a 7-consecutive-day period or after.

You donât have to make the trip to Tuscon to do a perimeter ride. We have one right here in the Evergreen State: PROS! Labor Day â September 1, 2014. The Perimeter Ride of Seattleâor PROSâis a Labor Day (September 1) ride organized by the Cyclists of Greater Seattle (COGS) that literally follows the perimeter of Seattle. PROS circumscribes the city, following a counter-clockwise route from its start at Discovery Park.
If you're riding long, steep mountain passes regularly, the compact will serve you better. For example, to ride a climb at 9 MPH using standard gearing you will be pushing 80RPM, while the same 9 MPH with the compact will allow you to spin around 92RPM, given the same rear cog gearing.
If you compare the gearing of the cranksets (keeping the same cassette in the rear) you'll see that the compact crankset is about 15% lower gearing than the standard, and the sub compact is about 8% lower gearing. This means that for every pedal revolution, the bike will move forward 15% and 8% less.
pro riders set up and bike sizes. I've been searching the net trying to find the sizes used by some of the top pro riders with little success. Does anybody know a site with this info?

With nine speeds, your limiter tends to be how wide your cassette range can be. In other words, you dont find many 9-speed cassettes that have a very small cog in the first position and a huge cog in the ninth position (barring, of course, mountain bike 9-speed systems).

In the social sciences, framing comprises a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives on how individuals, groups, and societies organize, perceive, and communicate about reality.
Because we live in an era where one must first âqualifyâ before one may opine, I guess I should say, âas a victim of repeated, sometimes violent sexual abuseâ, I find this trend toward calling everything âunsafeâ and immobilizing to be really, a bit much.

In social theory, framing is a schema of interpretation, a collection of anecdotes and stereotypes, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events. In other words, people build a series of mental filters through biological and cultural influences.
The answer is not to reshape the public square to accommodate them, because literally anything (a color, a smell) can be a trigger. Trigger warnings exist only to claim public victim status and reshape the debate.

A tissue is made up of a group of cells that usually look similar to one another and come from the same region in a developing embryo. The group of cells that make up a tissue have physiological functions that work together in a coordinated way to support special functions. The special function of a tissue is also influenced by the kind of material that surrounds the tissue and by communication among the cells of the tissue. Different kinds of tissue have different physical properties. Tissues may be hard (bone), soft (muscle), or even liquid (blood).

One of the best-known examples of allegory, Plato 's Allegory of the Cave, forms a part of his larger work The Republic. In this allegory, Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall (514a-b).
Allegory. Definition: An allegory is a story with (count 'em) two levels of meaning. First, there's the surface of the story. You know, the characters and plot and all that obvious stuff. Then there's the symbolic level, or the deeper meaning that all the jazz on the surface represents. The symbolic meaning of an allegory can be political or religious, historical or philosophical.
An allegory is a literary device used to tell stories on two levels: the literal and the figurative. The literal level is the plot, characters and setting. The figurative level is what these elements represent.
Included below is a list of literary terms that can help you interpret, critique, and respond to a variety of different written works. This list is by no means comprehensive, but instead offers a primer to the language frequently used by scholars and students researching literary works.
Animal Farm is a fable, or a type of allegory, that uses animals and other non-human characters to deliver a message, lesson or commentary. Another type of allegory is the parable, which has only human characters and is even more straightforward than the fable.
1 Tone: A way of communicating information (in writing, images, or sound) that conveys an attitude. 2  Authors convey tone through a combination of word-choice, imagery, perspective, style, and subject matter. 3  By adopting a specific tone, authors can help readers accurately interpret meaning in a text.
Sometimes authors deliberately tell their stories on two levels: a literal level and a figurative level. In an allegory, authors use their characters, setting and plot to entertain, while simultaneously delivering a moral, lesson or even a commentary on big concepts, like religion, and institutions, like the government.
Allegory of Music by Filippino Lippi (between 1475 and 1500): The Allegory of Music is a popular theme in painting. Lippi uses symbols popular during the High Renaissance, many of which refer to Greek mythology.
Writers or speakers typically use allegories as literary devices or as rhetorical devices that convey hidden meanings through symbolic figures, actions, imagery, and/or events, which together create the moral, spiritual, or political meaning the author wishes to convey.
As a literary device, an allegory in its most general sense is an extended metaphor. Allegory has been used widely throughout history in all forms of art, largely because it can readily illustrate complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners.
It is important to view Noyes and hi s followers against the backdrop of this period in order to understand their motivation for starting a utopian community and how that community fits into the larger utopian model established by the Puritans in the 17th century.
The Church of the Latter Day Saints, also known as the Mormon Church, was founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith. Smith claimed that God had led him to a new set of scriptures called the Book of Mormon. Further, Smith espoused polygamy as part of his utopian society. Smith and his followers were persecuted in Ohio and the midwest. In 1844, a mob murdered Smith and his brother Hyrum in Illinois.
The Oneida Community. The founder of the Oneida Community was John Humphrey Noyes. He was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, in 1811. John Humphrey came from a well established home where his father, also named John, was a congressman and Dartmouth graduate.
In the first part of the 19th century, more than 100,000 individuals formed Utopian communities in an effort to create perfect societies. The idea of a perfect society intertwined with communalism can be traced back to Plato's Republic, the book of Acts in the New Testament, and the works of Sir Thomas More.

It seems there is some confusion on exactly what Kratom Capsules are and that they supposedly don't work as well as Kratom Leaves or Kratom Powder.
Kratom Capsules make it easier to use Kratom instead of trying to choke down the powder or take the time to prepare Kratom Tea. Many people really like the benefits they get from Kratom just not the taste or time it takes to make so Kratom Capsules are a great option without sacrficing benefits.

It is probably a matter more of personal preference â for example,you just canât stand to take pills or capsules.
Chronic and acute alcohol use also can commonly cause abnormal liver blood tests. In alcoholic hepatitis, the range of liver tests can vary greatly. In chronic alcohol liver disease or alcoholic cirrhosis, slight elevation of ALT and AST may be observed, whereas in acute alcoholic hepatitis, high liver enzyme numbers are often seen.
If obesity is suspected as the cause of fatty liver disease, weight reduction of about 5% to 10% should also bring the AST and ALT liver blood tests to normal or near normal levels in some individuals.
Thus, the exact levels of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future. For example, individuals with acute viral hepatitis A may develop very high AST and ALT levels (sometimes in the thousands of units/liter range).
The SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transminase) or AST test, actually, measures the amount of a protein enzyme called glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase occurring in human blood of the patient. This enzyme is normally found in the liver, heart muscles, muscles, bones and red blood cells.
It is important to clarify that ALT and AST levels do not reflect the function of the liver, even though they commonly are referred to as liver function tests or LFTs. They only are used to detect inflammation due to injury or damage to the liver from any source. Even in conditions when AST and ALT are very elevated, the liver may function properly.
AST or SGOT is found in the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells, and it is commonly measured clinically as a marker for liver health But it is not a true marker of health of liver as it is not exclusively found in liver.
Both mother and son tested negative for any type of hepatitis. An elevated SGOT usually is a reflection of damage to liver cells. Hepatitis due to virus or drugs is the most likely cause. A value high above 200ut/ml would probably not be due to alcohol-induced liver damage. The following are the medical conditions in which SGOT may be raised. Acute kidney failure. Cirrhosis (scarring of the liver)
An abnormal high level of blood of SGOT shows the extent of damage to liver and muscles of body. Causes for a high elevated SGOT level may include infection, viral hepatitis, mononucleosis, gallbladder disease, the presence of toxins from drugs or adverse effects of chemicals and drugs or alcohol and various types of cancers.
AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. However, it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with liver disease.
AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases. But it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with liver disease. They may mean liver problems or they may not.
A. No. The two situations in which a court order is not required for a creditor to garnish wages is: 1  when an individual turns in an assignment of wages to a credit union.  when an individual owes unpaid taxes to the Canada Revenue Agency.
Then they must return to court to get an enforcement order for the garnishment or other means of collection. Creditors also hire companies to investigate public documents regarding property ownership and income. If they have reason to believe you have sufficient income or assets, they will come after you.
Because the 6 days would not raise the garnishment and the 4 days of work lower the garnishment because the garnishment was too high a percentage of 4 days of work. Depends on pay periods/dates, and how the garnishment order is written. Different scenarios, ignoring mandatory taxes, assuming an hourly wage of $10, a weekly pay date, and a set garnishment of $150 a week, not to exceed 40% of net pay: $10 x 40 hours = $400 pay - $150 garnishment=$250 net to employee.
Garnishment is a legal procedure used by creditors to collect debts that are owed to them. It is generally applied in cases where accounts are at least six months past due and no effort has been made by the debtor to establish a repayment arrangement.
In wage garnishment, an employer is ordered by a judge to withhold some portion of an indebted individualâs earnings from wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses and/or income from a retirement plan or pension, and use those garnished funds to pay back a creditor.
Once initiated, wage garnishment will generally continue until stopped by court order or until the debt is paid in full. It is better to be proactive and avoid garnishment by working out a repayment plan with your creditors.
I do payroll for a small company. I have one employee with a child support garnishment, which is mandatory by state law, so the garnishment does not reflect on the individual. I have seen a few other garnishments over the years.
Here it's usually a flat amount per pay period, not to exceed a certain percentage of base net income (gross wages less mandatory taxes; you can't reduce your net income by funding a retirement account or other non-mandatory items and say Sorry, not enough net pay after everything to pay child support).
If you are facing garnishment, you should do the following: 1  Validate any debt you are asked to pay by contacting the creditor or collection agency and asking for proof of the obligation.  Respond to any court summons. Failure to show up at a court hearing will likely ensure a garnishment judgment against you.
A creditor must get the right to garnish someoneâs earnings in a court of law. After the creditor â which can be a utility, a bank, a business or an individual â wins a lawsuit against a delinquent debtor, a notice called a Writ of Garnishment is sent to the debtorâs employer.

The risk for prostate cancer in men with PIN on their initial biopsy was much lower than the 51% earlier reported. In fact, the findings were surprising: 28% with PIN subsequently had cancer detected. The incidence of subsequent cancer diagnosis had decreased from 51% to 28% in the patients with PIN.
Prostate cancer begins when cells in the prostate gland start to grow uncontrollably. The prostate is a gland found only in males. It makes some of the fluid that is part of semen. The prostate is below the bladder and in front of the rectum. The size of the prostate changes with age. In younger men, it is about the size of a walnut, but it can be much larger in older men. Just behind the prostate are glands called seminal vesicles that make most of the fluid for semen.
P504S can be used as a positive marker for PIN. It will be useful to. confirm the diagnosis of small focus of prostate carcinoma in needle biopsies. The combination of P504S + HMW CKs + p63 (PIN-4â¢ Cocktail) may be extremely. useful for diagnosing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, especially in difficult cases, and in cases with limited tissues.
PIN and Prostate Cancer: New Studies Show Less Risk. by William J. Catalon, MD. PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), a microscopic finding reported in 5% to 10% of prostate biopsies, has been regarded as a red flag suggesting the possible presence of cancer.
The risk for prostate cancer in men with PIN on their initial biopsy was much lower than the 51% earlier reported. In fact, the findings were surprising: 28% with PIN subsequently had cancer detected. ...Likely in past that cancers were missed in initial biopsy and only the PIN was detected..
Prostate cancer is a malignant tumour that starts in cells of the prostate. Malignant means that it can spread, or metastasize, to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in Canadian men. It usually grows slowly and can often be completely removed or managed successfully.
Thus p63 is useful as a differential. marker for benign and malignant tumors of prostate gland and can be useful as a. negative marker. Expression of P504S protein is found in prostatic adenocarcinoma, but not in benign. prostatic tissue. It has also been found to stain premalignant lesions of the prostate:
There are several reasons why PIN is the most likely prostate cancer precursor. PIN is more common in men with prostate cancer. High grade PIN can be found in 85 to 100% of radical prostatectomy specimens, nearby or even in connection with prostate cancer. It tends to occur in the peripheral zone of the prostate. With age, it becomes increasingly multifocal, like prostate cancer.
In urologic pathology, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, abbreviated HGPIN, is an abnormality of prostatic glands and believed to precede the development of prostate adenocarcinoma (the most common form of prostate cancer).
In some cases, changes to prostate cells can cause prostate cancer. Most often, prostate cancer starts in glandular cells of the prostate. These cells make a part of the seminal fluid. This type of cancer is called adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

The screw-pine or pandan leaves are tied in a knot and placed in soups or stews that are being cooked. The leaf is also bruised or raked with the tines of a fork to release its aroma, pounded to release its aromatic juice, or even boiled to obtain its flavor.
Pandan is used for handicrafts. Craftsmen collect the pandan leaves from plants in the wild. Only the mature leaves are cut so the plant will naturally regenerate. The leaves are sliced in fine strips and sorted for further processing.
The species vary in size from small shrubs less than 1 m (3.3 ft) tall, to medium-sized trees 20 m (66 ft) tall, typically with a broad canopy, heavy fruit, and moderate growth rate. The trunk is stout, wide-branching, and ringed with many leaf scars. Mature plants can have branches.
Buko Pandan is a popular Filipino Dessert; this is made using young coconut and Screwpine leaves (locally known as âPandanâ). At first glance, this sumptuous dessert can be mistaken for Buko Salad because of the similarity in texture and dairy ingredients used.
Pandanus is a genus of monocots with some 750 accepted species. They are palm-like, dioecious trees and shrubs native to the Old World tropics and subtropics. Common names include pandan (/ËpÃ¦ndÉn/), screw palm, and screw pine. They are classified in the order Pandanales, family Pandanaceae.

Pandan leaf is long, thin, narrow, and green. It is sold fresh, frozen, or dried. The leaves and flowers also come as bright green extracts. Properties: the dried leaves are less fragrant than the fresh leaves. The leaves have to be bruised or boiled in order to release their flavor.
What is Pandan Leaf? Daun pandan is the Malaysian and Indonesian name for this fragrant leaf. Screwpine leaf was the name given by English traders who traveled to Asia. In Southeast Asia, pandan leaf is used to wrap chicken, meat, fish, and desserts before they are barbecued or steamed.
For those who want to use fresh pandan leaves, try boiling 3 leaves in 2 cups of water. The liquid derived from this should replace the water and buko pandan flavoring. Try this recipe and let me know your thoughts. Combine water and powdered gelatin then stir using a spoon.
Limits to Cell Size. There are 2 main reasons why cells are so small: 2) it would. take too. long for. materials. to diffuse. within the.
Although there is wide variation in the. size and shape of bacterial and archaeal cells, all such cells contain a. plasma membrane, chromosomes, and ribosomes; almost all have a. stiff cell wall. Some prokaryotes have flagella and/or inner.
This cell wall exoskeleton provides the bacteria with several benefits. The cell wall protects the bacterium from damage by encircling it with a tough, rigid structure. This structure is also porous. Small molecules are able to freely pass through the cell wall to the membrane, but large molecules are excluded. In this way, the cell wall acts as a coarse filter.
Bacterial cells are covered by a cell envelope that is composed of a cell membrane and a cell wall. The cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer that regulates the transport of molecules into and out of the cell. This is the weak structure that would burst from the osmotic pressure without reinforcement.
Chapter 6 introduced an essential part of the cell: the. plasma membrane. Thanks to the selective permeability of. phospholipid bilayers and the activity of membrane trans-. port proteins, this structure creates an internal environment. that is different from conditions outside the cell. Our task.
Other prokaryotes have only a plasma membrane. Bacteria are also surrounded by a cell wall composed of peptidoglycan (amino acids and sugars). Some eukaryotic cells also have cell walls, but none that are made of peptidoglycan. The outer membrane of gram negative bacteria is rich in lipopolysaccharides.
Thus, the cell wall can be several layers thick, each layer being a sheet of linked peptidoglycan units. The Gram-positive bacterial cell wall is distinguished by having multiple layers of peptidoglycan sheets and is thus up to ten times the thickness of a Gram-negative bacterial cell wall.
4. Has a rigid cell wall made of peptidoglycan (except for the mycoplasma). This cell wall is thick in Gram-positive bacteria and thin in Gram-negative bacteria. It is the thickness of the peptidoglycan that accounts for the ability/lack of ability to retain the crystal violet used in the Gram stain.
7. May have a flagellum which arises from the plasma membrane and protrudes through the cell wall. This is the source of the H antigen which is used in serologic diagnosis. It is also the motility organ and possibly an organ for attachment to a human cell. It is considered a virulence factor.
Cell membrane. The cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane or cytoplasmic membrane) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment. The cell membrane is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules and controls the movement of substances in and out of cells.

As of 2/12/14: We've had quite a few Hey, come use this AWD. It's great type of posts. When the AWD doesn't give a good discount, but is only posted to try to get renters to use the AWD of someone so the poster can earn free days from their Avis Corporate account. From here out, please put the company/trade group/etc that's associated with the AWD or we'll delete the post to keep it on-topic here.
Most AWD systems deliver power primarily to one set of wheels, front or rear. When slippage is detected at one axle, power is diverted to the other axle, in hopes of finding more traction there. Not all AWD systems are equal. Subaruâs AWD system always directs at least 20-percent of the engineâs power to the rear, and it can direct a larger amount aft if needed.
One more thing to try: on page 2 of making a reservation (where you see the car classes), on the drop-down page up top, see if selecting This AWD - xxxxxxx instead of Lowest Rates makes a difference. I've seen that forcing an AWD sometimes is lower than their lowest rates for some reason.
Automakers have long boasted that all-wheel drive is all you need to get your car through winterâs fury. Last updated: September 29, 2015 11:00 AM. Tires. Forty-one percent of all weather-related car crashes on U.S. roads are due to conditions involving snow, sleet, ice, and slush.
Navigation System* with 12.3-inch or 8-inch color multimedia display, Lexus Enform App Suite,* 12-speaker Lexus Premium Sound System and more.
All-wheel drive is a lighter-duty system used for cars and car-based SUVs. AWD systems operate continuously, and they automatically vary power delivery to the front and rear wheels when needed. Some systems remain in front- or rear-wheel-drive mode until slip is detected, then power is routed to all four wheels. Other systems send power to all four wheels continuously.
For rain and very light snow, 2WD will likely work fine, and for most vehicles, front-wheel drive is the preferred setup. (For performance cars, RWD is preferred, but AWD, if available, can increase traction. AWD is fine for most normal snow conditions or for light-duty, off-pavement excursions.
All-wheel drive is far better than two-wheel drive when it comes to driving on slick surfaces where you need serious traction to get going, such as a snowy uphill driveway. But our tests found that all-wheel drive by itself wonât help if youâre heading too fast toward a sudden sharp curve on a snowy night.
As the name implies, all-wheel drive (AWD) feeds power to each corner. Depending on the system (designs vary), AWD can provide maximum forward traction during acceleration. It is especially helpful in sloppy road conditions and when driving over moderate off-road terrain.
Garlic is an herb. It is best known as a flavoring for food. But over the years, garlic has been used as a medicine to prevent or treat a wide range of diseases and conditions. The fresh clove or supplements made from the clove are used for medicine.Garlic is used for many conditions related to the heart and blood system.These conditions include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, heart attack, and âhardening of the arteriesâ (atherosclerosis).arlic produces a chemical called allicin. This is what seems to make garlic work for certain conditions. Allicin also makes garlic smell. Some products are made âodorlessâ by aging the garlic, but this process can also make the garlic less effective.
Garlic (Allium sativum), a herb used widely as a flavoring in cooking, has also been used as a medicine throughout ancient and modern history to prevent and treat a wide range of conditions and diseases.

Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs).
The big draws of Bluetooth are that it is wireless, inexpensive and automatic. There are other ways to get around using wires, including infrared communication. Infrared (IR) refers to light waves of a lower frequency than human eyes can receive and interpret. Infrared is used in most television remote control systems.
How Bluetooth Creates a Connection. Â­Bluetooth takes small-area networking to the next level by removing the need for user intervention and keeping transmission power extremely low to save battery power. Picture this: You're on your Bluetooth-enabled cell phone, standing outside the door to your house.
Setting Up Device Name for Bluetooth Connection: 1  To be able to edit the settings for Bluetooth, you will have to turn it on first.You can turn on Bluetooth quickly by swiping down your finger from the status bar. 2  This will launch the Notification center. 3  Just tap on the Bluetooth icon to turn it on.
Bluetooth uses the microwave radio frequency spectrum in the 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz range. Maximum power output from a Bluetooth radio is 100 mW for class 1, 2.5 mW for class 2, and 1 mW for class 3 devices. Even the maximum power output of class 1 is a lower level than the lowest powered mobile phones.
Changing Device Name from Settings: Note: You will see the option to change device name only if you have an Android device with Android 4.2 and above. The easiest way to change the device name of your Android device is doing it from the About screen itself. Open Settings on your phone or tablet, scroll to About and tap on it. On the next screen, tap on Device Name, type the desired name for your device in the text field and select OK.
Five minutes later, when your friend calls you back, your Bluetooth-enabled home phone rings instead of your cell phone. The person called the same number, but your home phone picked up the Bluetooth signal from your cell phone and automatically re-routed the call because it realized you were home.
Assigning a desired device name is pretty much the same like that of Bluetooth. Letâs see how you can do it. 1  Again, to edit WiFi settings, you will have to enable it first. 2  Go to your deviceâs Settings panel and tap on the toggle slider to enable it.
As soon as you walk in the house, the map you received on your cell phone from your car's Bluetooth-enabled GPS system is automatically sent to your Bluetooth-enabled computer, because your cell phone picked up a Bluetooth signal from your PC and automatically sent the data you designated for transfer.
1 Go to your deviceâs Settings panel and tap on the toggle slider to enable it. 2  Next, tap on the âWi-Fiâ text to see the configuration screen. 3  Tap on âWi-Fi Directâ button on the bottom (for Samsung devices), or launch options menu to see the âWi-Fi Directâ option (for AOSP) and then tap on it.
Fiddler on the Roof. This article is about the 1964 musical. For the film, see Fiddler on the Roof (film). Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and book by Joseph Stein, set in the Pale of Settlement of Imperial Russia in 1905. It is based on Tevye and his Daughters (or Tevye the Dairyman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem.
âWonder of Wondersâ offers a particularly thoughtful analysis of how âFiddlerâ â a midcentury showbiz creation â has achieved something like folklore status in the American imagination, and grapples, as any history of this musical must, with fundamental questions about Jewish identity.
Harnick wrote âWonder of Wondersâ in his hotel room, mining the Gideon Bible in his nightstand for mentions of miracles. Robbins was still tinkering with it as late as two weeks before âFiddlerâ opened on Broadway on Sept. 22, 1964. At last, obsessed by something heâd seen done by a Brooklyn Hasid heâd nicknamed âMr.
Fiddler on the Roof. Outside the town of Zagreb, Yugoslavia, the cast and crew of the film version of Fiddler on the Roof (1971) charged ahead with the heady task of outdoing their greatest competition: the long-running Broadway stage version of the same name.
His understated performance, however, was a success on film, and served as a sharp contrast to Mostel's over the top antics that worked best onstage. Topol, however, quickly faded into obscurity after Fiddler - as did the rest of the cast, actually - with one exception.
It's set in the Orthodox Jewish section of the tiny Russian ghetto town called Anatevka in the early 1900s. This film is a bit overlong, and a little boring here and there, but aside from that, it is wonderful. It works better as a stage production, but it's still fine as a film.
Norman Jewison was well respected as a director, thanks to In the Heat of the Night (1967) and The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), two very tough and masculine films. Fiddler on the Roof was thus a formidable challenge as it was his first foray into the musical genre. Early on in the project, Jewison determined that the film's success depended on a strong element of realism throughout the production, hence his extensive travels from Canada to much of Eastern Europe.
Those searching for razzle-dazzle bar mitzvah entertainment need look no further than the Amazing Bottle Dancers , a group of athletic young men whoâll burst into your special event , hoist the guest of honor up onto a chair , perform the suspenseful â bottle dance â from the wedding scene in â Fiddler on the Roof, â and then , for a grand finale , ...
This âFiddlerâ featured black and Latino preteens in the lead roles at a time when black-Jewish tensions in the neighborhood had reached an all-time high. And yet its cast members echoed one original Broadway choristerâs ardent declaration that, while working on the show, they came âto love our village.â.
Critic Reviews for Fiddler on the Roof. All Critics (37) | Top Critics (8) | Fresh (30) | Rotten (7) | DVD (9) There are some contrived and artificial moments in Fiddler, but it becomes more convincing, naturalistic, and involving as it goes on, and finally builds to a powerful climax.

I found this answer just by googling pop music. The standard format of pop music is the song, customarily less than five minutes in duration, and with an instrumentation that can range from an orchestra to a lone singer.
And I say that as someone who grew up with real punk and don't care very much for pop punk.. The Ramones certainly didn't originate the scaling down of rock music - that had already been happening with people like Jonathan Richman as far back as the early 70s.
As that indicates, the music business needs to know what it's selling and who it's selling to. Hillbilly music, a term that predates country music, was the coinage of Ralph Peer, who in 1925 recorded a North Carolina group he named the Hillbillies.
Eno says in his famous liner notes from 1975's Discreet Music that the idea had come to him while recuperating in hospital after getting hit by a car in January 1975; a guest put 18th-century harp music on at low volume, then left the immobile Eno to ponder its placement.

To have any understanding of the significance of contemporary South Korean culture and Kpop music let alone South Korean pop culture, you must understand how the South Korea of today came to be. South Korea has had an incredible journey over the past 60 years.
In what country did pop music originate in? I'm in choir and we have to write a 4-5 sentance paragraph about 1 type of music. I need to know where it originated and stuff like that.....basicly its origin. Are you sure you want to delete this answer?
The 90s were rife with musician-coined genres. Riot grrrl was the name of a 1991 fanzine put together by four of that music's key players: Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman of Bratmobile; Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail of Bikini Kill. Illbient was coined in 1994 by DJ Olive, of the trio We, to describe a multimedia presentation to a journalist in Brooklyn.
More often, a genre name will come from a musician's works. Free jazz comes from Ornette Coleman's 1960 album of the same name; ditto blue-eyed soul, from the Righteous Brothers' 1963 LP.
As derided as pop-punk often is among the more hardcore set - it's probably more true to the spirit of Johnny Ramone than a lot of other bands were. The Ramones certainly didn't originate the scaling down of rock music - that had already been happening with people like Jonathan Richman as far back as the early 70s. One could even make a case for bands like The Kinks being the first punk groups.
I found this answer just by googling pop music. The term pop music was first used in 1926 in the sense of having popular appeal, but since the 1950s, it has been used to designate a musical genre, originally characterized as a lighter alternative to rock & roll.[3][4]
Melanie Hamilton Wilkes didnât survive Gone With the Wind. But the actress who played her, Olivia de Havilland, is the last remaining star from the Oscar-winning Best Picture of 1939, and today celebrates her 100th birthday. âIâm certainly relishing the idea of living a century,â she told Entertainment Weekly last year.
My paralysis was total. I felt Olivia would spring across the table and grab me by the hair. I felt age 4, being confronted by my older sister. Damn it, I'd incurred her wrath again! STORY: Legendary Actress Joan Fontaine Dies at 96. De Havilland went on to win two Oscars, but that apparently didn't warm her to Fontaine.
De Havilland, whose father was an English professor and patent attorney in Japan, was born in Tokyo on July 1, 1916. Fifteen months later, her sister, Joan, arrived.

De Havilland on Monday issued a statement through the DGRW Talent Agency, saying she was shocked and saddened by the news and that she was grateful for the many kind expressions of sympathies. Fontaine, 96, died in her sleep Sunday at her home in Carmel, Calif.
The 97-year-old de Havilland is a longtime resident of Paris and over the years often declined to talk about her sister. PHOTOS: Hollywood's Notable Deaths of 2013
Happy 100th Birthday, Olivia de Havilland! 10 Facts About the Screen Legend. As we celebrate Olivia de Havilland's 100th birthday, here's a look a her legendary life and career.
NEW YORK â In rare public remarks about her sister and fellow Oscar-winning actress, Olivia de Havilland mourned the loss of Joan Fontaine, with whom de Havilland reportedly feuded for much of their lives.
De Havilland recently told Vanity Fair that the two sisters fought constantly from early girlhood, after Olivia, age six, accidentally chipped Joanâs collarbone when Joan mischievously tried to drag her into a pool.
Fontaine, who always suspected that their mother liked de Havilland more, brushed her sister aside when de Havilland tried to congratulate her on her win, humiliating her. When de Havilland won her first Oscar, for 1946âs To Each His Own, it was her turn to snub Fontaine as she approached the dais.

The last one was recorded by the NY Times at 12:27 am EST, several minutes before the Titanic sank, ending in mid sentence In 2012, the east coast of the United States is now in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), which wasn't used in 1912.
Timeline of events. At 11.40pm on Sunday 14 April 1912, almost 100 years ago, the Titanic was just four days into its first voyage when it struck an iceberg. But how long did it take for the ocean liner to sink?
11.40pm-Titanic hits iceberg. Within minutes of hitting the iceberg the boat begins to take on thousands of tonnes of sea water through holes in its hull. The man that designed the ship, Thomas Andrews, is on board and goes to look at the damage.
Many of the Titanic lifeboats were launched when they werenât at full capacity and some were even lost during the event. Those who were in first and second class had the largest chance of survival. Nearly 50% of lives lost during the sinking of the Titanic were those who were in third class. A strict women and children first policy meant that most of the Titanic survivors were women and children from first and second class.
The sinking of the Titanic was a long and horrifying event. It took nearly two hours for the vessel to sink completely, and by 2:20 am the Titanic was at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean.
Times are updated throughout the journey. So anyone who is trying to follow the Titanic sinking in real time will need to first understand the ship's time, and then do another calculation based on their timezone.
12.30am, 15 April 1912 - Lifeboats are lowered. The captain, Edward J Smith, orders the lifeboats to be lowered. After ten minutes passengers start leaving the ship, with women and children taking the first spots.
That means 12:30 am would now be 1:30 am, EDT. Give or take a few minutes, that's when the Titanic sank. 1:30 am, EDT or 5:30 am, GMT. Calculate from there based on your own time zone.
Based on ship time, the Titanic struck the iceberg at approximately 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912, sinking at approximately 2:20 am on April 15, 1912, two hours and forty minutes later. Those are the dates and times we see reguarly, but very rarely will we see a conversion to GMT or Zulu time.
Setting sail for its maiden voyage on April 10, 1912 from Southampton, England and bound for New York City, the Titanic carried 2,223 passengers toward its destination. The ship made stops in Cherebourg, France and Queensland, Ireland and continued on its voyage through the North Atlantic ocean.

The word Satanism is an umbrella term which encompasses many different styles of belief and practice. Similar to other religions, Satanism has developed into distinct sects over time, one side preferring a more spiritual or religious approach, and the other side prefering a more material and symbolic approach.verall, something is ''Satanic'' because it is focused on the central figure of Satan, through mythology, symbolism, or spiritual and religious reverence.

The Simpsons: history of the series. When Homer, Bart, Marge, Lisa and Maggie first appeared on our screens in 1987, in a series of 30-second animated cartoon shorts, no-one could predict the cultural phenomenon The Simpsons would become. The 500th episode of The Simpsons will be broadcast in February 2012 Photo: REX. By Sarah Rainey.
The family debuted as shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show called The Simpsons, which debuted on December 17, 1989. The show was an early hit for Fox, becoming the first Fox series to land in the top 30 ratings in a season (1990).
Groening named the Simpsons after members of his own family - except for Bart, which is an anagram of brat - and the finished product was first shown on variety series The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.
Homer is the oafish unhealthy beer loving father, Marge is the hardworking homemaker wife, Bart is the ten year old underachiever (and proud of it), Lisa is the unappreciated eight year old genius, and Maggie is the cute, pacifier loving silent infant. Written by Sam Kelly.

In common law jurisdictions and mixed civil-common law jurisdictions, the law of remedies distinguishes between a legal remedy (e.g. a specific amount of monetary damages) and an equitable remedy (e.g. injunctive relief or specific performance).
For example, in a custody case, an injunction may be used to prevent a party from removing a child from the country. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy granted when money damages are not able to compensate the plaintiff's violation of rights if an injuction is not granted.
Injunction Law and Legal Definition. Injunctive relief consists of a court order called an injunction, requiring an individual to do or not do a specific action. It is an extraordinary remedy that courts utilize in special cases where preservation of the status quo or taking some specific action is required in order to prevent possible injustice.
For example, in a custody case, an injunction may be used to prevent a party from removing a child from the country. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy granted when money damages are not able to compensate the plaintiff's violation of rights if an injunction is not granted.
Search Legal Terms and Definitions. injunctive relief. n. a court-ordered act or prohibition against an act or condition which has been requested, and sometimes granted, in a petition to the court for an injunction. Such an act is the use of judicial (court) authority to handle a problem and is not a judgment for money.
For protection orders (family law and harassment), see Protection order. An injunction is an equitable remedy in the form of a court order that compels a party to do or refrain from specific acts. A party that fails to comply with an injunction faces criminal or civil penalties, including possible monetary sanctions and even imprisonment. They can also be charged with contempt of court.
Injunctive Relief. Injunctive relief, also known as an âinjunction,â is a legal remedy that may be sought in a civil lawsuit, in addition to, or in place of, monetary damages. Rather than offering money as payment for a wrong in a civil action, injunctive relief is a court order for the defendant to stop a specified act or behavior. To explore this concept, consider the injunctive relief definition.
Legal remedy. A legal remedy, also judicial relief or a judicial remedy, is the means with which a court of law, usually in the exercise of civil law jurisdiction, enforces a right, imposes a penalty, or makes another court order to impose its will.

Pollution is a worldwide problem that affects air, water and soil. Various human activities, mainly since the industrial revolution, have created waste products that have simply been released into the environment without any thought being given to their effects.
Disposal of human excreta and animal dung: The rain washes away human excreta and animal dung into rivers, ponds and lakes. Drinking this polluted water may cause several water-borne diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, jaundice, typhoid and cholera. Polluted river-water can cause diseases to the whole population.
Ad. Among the causes of pollution of this type, the automobile is probably the biggest. Vehicle exhausts are a major source of carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming, and toxic carbon monoxide.
Infested with waste ranging from floating plastic bags to chemical waste, our water bodies have turned into a pool of poison. The contamination of water bodies in simplest words means water pollution. Thereby the abuse of lakes, ponds, oceans, rivers, reservoirs etc is water pollution.
Causes of Water Pollution. Let us now study the causes of water pollution. 1. Industrial waste: Industries produce huge amount of waste which contains toxic chemicals and pollutants which can cause air pollution and damage to us and our environment.
Pollution of water occurs when substances that will modify the water in negative fashion are discharged in it. This discharge of pollutants can be direct as well as indirect. Water pollution is an appalling problem, powerful enough to lead the world on a path of destruction.
Global warming: An increase in earthâs temperature due to greenhouse effect results in global warming. It increases the water temperature and result in death of aquatic animals and marine species which later results in water pollution. 10. Radioactive waste: Nuclear energy is produced using nuclear fission or fusion.
Disposal of waste: This waste includes sewage, garbage and liquid waste from factories and homes. Wastages from chemical factories contain many toxic or poisonous chemicals. These are discharged into rivers. The river-water becomes poisonous for fish and other aquatic animals and plants.
The two chief sources of water pollution can be seen as Point and Non Point. Point refer to the pollutants that belong to a single source. An example of this would be emissions from factories into the water. Non Point on the other hand means pollutants emitted from multiple sources.
The burning of fossil fuels is not the largest source of pollution. Not in the US and not in the world. Not in the air, or the water, or the land. This post is laughably incorrect. Industrial agriculture, particularly livestock farming operations, put fossil fuel emissions to shame.

Following my recent article entitled The art and science of naming a dog I received a number of queries from readers asking me about what the most popular dog names were. When I started to check several different online resources, it became clear that there were some differences depending upon geographical location.
Dog Names. Looking for dog names is both fun and serious business. Whether you're looking for male dog names or female dog names, there are many ways to choose the right name for your new dog or puppy. The dog name you pick reflects just as much about you as it does the dog that's being named.
Dog Names - Male & Female Puppy Names. You finally have your new puppy, but what about a name? Choosing a name for your dog can be hard if you aren't very creative, so we have compiled a list of over 1,000 dog names to help!
Most popular male and female dog names. Most of us put a lot of thought into naming our new dog or puppy. We realize our dogâs name will speak volumes about our own personality, insights, or sense of humor. And what a great way of revealing just a tidbit of information about yourself to passers-by.
Grab your chainsaws and umbrellas: Sharknado 4, titled Sharknado: The 4th Awakens, is coming and along with the sharks falling from the sky, there will be plenty of celebrity cameos to shake your robotic hand at.
Posted on 8/1/16. Sharknado 4: The Fourth Awakens tore through Sunday night, leaving significant celebrity carnage in its wake. See how our very own stars of Chrisley Knows Best fared as Syfy's devastating human-chomping storm ripped through Las Vegas in this clip starring Todd, Savannah, and Grayson Chrisley.
In addition to the stars from Chrisley Knows Best, the cameo list has an impressive roster that features Vince Neil (Motley Crue), Wayne Newton (aka Mr. Las Vegas), Dr. Drew Pinsky, plus many more -- and this is just the first wave! Sharknado: The 4th Awakens premieres Sunday, July 31 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. And speaking of the Chrisleys, new episodes of Chrisley Knows Best resume this Tuesday at 10/9c.

Sharknado 4 takes place five years after the filmâs third installment (Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!) which debuted last summer. In the movie, the world has been sharknado-free since the incidents of the last film when suddenly, the sharks begin to fly again powered by tornadoes. However, this time they are showing up in unexpected places and in unusual ways. Once again, it is up to Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering) to save the world.

âSharknado 4â Review: This Joke Has No Teeth Anymore. A joke might be funny the first time, but by the fourth time you hear it, the punchline gets tired. âTiredâ is a good description for âSharknado 4: The 4th Awakens,â which premieres Sunday on Syfy. Although the parody movie is as absurd and silly as the first three installments were, this time around the whole thing feels forced.
Uh oh! Grab and umbrella and a chainsaw; we're getting close to sharknado season. Syfy announced its first round of celebrity cameos for their new Sharknado movie, and -- look out, everybody! -- Todd, Savannah, and Grayson Chrisley are on the list!
Cooking chicken with the skin on helps seal the juices and makes the chicken meat more tender and flavorful. More than half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsaturated fat--the healthy kind of fat. So, leave the skin on when cooking and remove the skin at the table to cut extra calories while saving flavor.
What part of the human body part is healthiest to eat? Is is DEFINITELY the muscles because they are made of protein, and meat is good for you because it has a lot of protein. Edit
Eating lower-fat alternatives will also help you maintain a healthy weight. Grilling, broiling and baking are great cooking methods to keep the fat content at its lowest. Selenium. Chicken is a great source of selenium, a trace element that has been shown to fight cancer.
Let me answer your second question first. Chicken is a good source of protein and other nutrients. Most of the nutritional differences between one part and another are too small to bother mentioning. The one useful difference is that dark meat has a bit more saturated fat and cholesterol than white meat. Even so, most of the fat in chicken is in the skin.
Myth 1: Always buy chicken labeled as hormone free or natural to get the healthiest bird for your family. The truth is that the word natural means nothing on a food package and no hormones are used in any chicken products.
The three healthiest oils generally speaking are olive oil, canola  oil and peanut oil. Olive oil isn't really appropriate for fried  chicken, it has a lower burning point tâ¦han other oils, meaning it  burns at lower tempertures, and it had a heavier, more distinctive  taste that might swamp your fried chicken.
Either canola oil or  peanut oil should work great, canola oil is generally less  expensive of the two and considered the healthiest, but peanut oil  is often recommended because of the flavor it gives fried foods.   Answer2: I actually read that coconut oil is the best for frying  and olive and avocado oil are excellent choices as well.
If you live in the United States, chicken is probably a staple in your diet, especially if you have implemented a healthy eating plan. Part of the meat and beans group of the Food Guide Pyramid, chicken is full of essential nutrients that your body needs, while carrying fewer of the unhealthy qualities that other meats have. A boneless, skinless chicken breast is an excellent low-fat food that can be prepared in a variety of ways and that fits into many different cuisines.
What type of chicken lays the healthiest eggs? The FDA determined after much testing that the nutritional value of hen's eggs is more-or-less identical from one species of hen to the next. it is commonly believed that brow â¦ n eggs are somehow more nourishing or otherwise better than white eggs.
Choices abound in the meat counter of the grocery store so read labels to find sodium content (make sure to take your reading glasses as all food labels can be hard to read for those of us over a certain age!) Myth 3: Boneless, skinless chicken breast is the healthiest of all chicken parts. It might be the lowest in total fat, but, to steal line from presenter and registered dietitian, Colleen Pierre, don't be afraid of the dark..
As I stated initially NSCA is âsort of the reverseâ of NRPE and the diagram above illustrates the process by which Nagios receives the check results. 1  NSClient++ decides it is time to run checks. 2  NSClient++ gathers all results. 3  NSClient++ connect to NSCA (server) and sends all results.  NSClient++ goes back to sleep.
Founded in 1985 by a National Science Foundation grant, the NCSA provides supercomputer resources to hundreds of universities and organizations engaged in scientific research. It was also the birthplace of the first Web server (HTTPd) and the Mosaic browser. See also NCSC.

Apache Web server. Related Terms. Often referred to as simply Apache, a public-domain open source Web server developed by a loosely-knit group of programmers. The first version of Apache, based on the NCSA httpd Web server, was developed in 1995.
For the browser that was later renamed, see Netscape Navigator. NCSA Mosaic, or simply Mosaic, is a discontinued early web browser. It has been credited with popularizing the World Wide Web. It was also a client for earlier protocols such as File Transfer Protocol, Network News Transfer Protocol, and gopher. The browser was named for its support of multiple internet protocols.
Using NSClient++ with NSCA#. NSCA (Nagios Service Check Acceptor) is a protocol which is used in reveres of the other common Nagios protocol NRPE. The idea is that you can submit passive check results to a Nagios server instead of having the Nagios server actively polling.

After the introduction of the Kindle 4 and Kindle Touch e-readers in September 2011, Amazon began describing the previous Kindle version as the 'Kindle Keyboard' instead of the Kindle 3. The 3G model is not available for all countries.
If youâve never owned a Kindle and are thinking of purchasing one and you donât need the huge screen of a Kindle DX model, I would highly, highly recommend the Kindle 3 because it is by far and large, the very best model that has been produced to date.

Thereâs Kindle 1, Kindle 2, and the new one is Kindle 3, available as WiFi or WiFi and 3G. Thereâs also Kindle DX. Weâve discussed this many times â find out what we said here: http://www.fluther.com/topics/kindle/.
The Kindle 2 added native PDF capability with the version 2.3 firmware upgrade. The Kindle 1 could not read PDF files, but Amazon provides experimental conversion to the native AZW format, with the caveat that not all PDFs may format correctly.
The Kindle Keyboard is available in two versions. One of these, the Kindle Wi-Fi, was initially priced at $139 / GBÂ£111 and connects to the Internet exclusively via Wi-Fi networks. The other version, considered a replacement to the Kindle 2, was priced at $189 / Â£152 and includes both 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity.
Amazon announced a new version of the regular Kindle and the Kindle Paperwhite on September 6, 2012. The Kindle 5 was released on September 6 ($69 ad-supported, $89 no ads). The Kindle has a black bezel (compared to the Kindle 4, which was available in silver-grey), better contrast, and hand-tuned fonts.
The fresh plant or juice of Cleavers herb is used as a medicinal poultice for wounds, ulcers and many other skin problems. An infusion has shown of benefit in the treatment of glandular fever, tonsilitis, hepatitis and cystitis. The infusion is also used to treat liver, bladder and urinary problems.
Uses and benefits of Cleavers. 1  One of the great lymphatic herbs. 2  Use in swollen lymph nodes, abscesses, boils and tumors. 3  A great blood cleanser.  Has diuretic properties and helps dissolve kidney and bladder 1  sediment. A strong herb for cleansing the skin.  Excellent for eczema, dermatitis and psoriasis.
Use cleaver seeds as a coffee substitute. The little clinging burrs of cleavers make a fair substitute for coffee in emergency situations. It is a tedious process, but if one is desperate for coffee and has plenty of time, a pleasant, strong coffee flavored beverage can be made using these seedpods.
Cleavers Herbal Use and Medicinal Properties. Cleavers has a long history of use as an alternative medicine and is still used widely by modern herbalists. It is used both internally and externally in the treatment of a wide range of ailments.
Cleavers is an annual plant found in moist or grassy places and along riverbanks and fences in Canada, the eastern half of the U.S., and the Pacific coast. A slender taproot produces the weak, square, procumbent or climbing, prickly stem that grows from 2 to 6 feet long.

Cleavers make an excellent cleansing tonic that purifies the lymphatic system and urinary tract. Cleavers help remove toxins from the blood and intestines. They also make a cooling drink when treating feverish conditions. Cleaver tea is often used as a wash for burns, scrapes, abrasions, ulcers, dandruff, itchy scalp, and other skin problems.

For a normal distribution $68\%$ percent of the distribution is within $1$ standard deviation. $95.4\%$ within $2$ standard deviations and over $99\%$ within $3$ standard deviations. The margin of error is expressed as a multiple of the standard deviation of the estimate. Variance and bias are measures of uncertainty in a random quantity.
The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean (or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size, which is the same thing) and is typically about twice the standard deviationâthe half-width of a 95 percent confidence interval.
Let's say that you're curious about studying the dimensions of the cars that happen to sit in the parking lot. And so you measure their lengths. Let's just make the computation simple. Let's say that there are five cars in the parking lot. The entire size of the population that we care about is 5. And you go and measure their lengths-- one car is 4 meters long, another car is 4.2 meters long, another car is 5 meters long, the fourth car is 4.3 meters long, and then, let's say the fifth car is 5.5 meters long. So let's come up with some parameters for this population.
Both the variance and the standard deviation meet these three criteria for normally-distributed (symmetric, bell-curve) data sets. The variance (Ï2) is a measure of how far each value in the data set is from the mean. Here is how it is defined: Subtract the mean from each value in the data.
Variance is defined and calculated as the average squared deviation from the mean. Standard deviation is calculated as the square root of variance or in full definition, standard deviation is the square root of the average squared deviation from the mean. These definitions may sound confusing when encountered for the first time.
Sample Standard Deviation. 1  Step 1. Work out the mean. 2  Step 2. Then for each number: subtract the Mean and square the result. 3  Step 3. Then work out the mean of those squared differences. 4  Step 4. Take the square root of that:
When we used the whole population we got: Mean = 7, Standard Deviation = 2.983... When we used the sample we got: Sample Mean = 6.5, Sample Standard Deviation = 3.619... Our Sample Mean was wrong by 7%, and our Sample Standard Deviation was wrong by 21%.
It is a corrected version of the equation obtained from modifying the population standard deviation equation by using the sample size as the size of the population, which removes some of the bias in the equation.
#Draw 6 values from a N(0,1) distribution and calculate #the variance using the true population mean and the #mean calculated from the sample - repeat 1E6 times n <- 6 m <- 1E+6 mu <- 0 sigma <- 1 v.pop <- numeric(m) v.sam <- numeric(m) for (i in 1:m) { x <- rnorm(n,mu,sigma) x.bar <- mean(x) v.sam[i] <- sum((x-x.bar)^2) / n v.pop[i] <- sum((x-mu)^2) / n } #if you use the true population mean to calculate the estimate of #the population variance, on the average you will get a good estimate ...
So what people like to do is talk in terms of standard deviation, which is just the square root of the variance, or the square root of sigma squared. And the symbol for the standard deviation is just sigma. So now that we've figured out the variance, it's very easy to figure out the standard deviation of both of these characters. The standard deviation of this first one up here, of this first data set, is going to be the square root of 200.
The northernmost of the Greenwich DLR stations, Cutty Sark is located in the Maritime Greenwich district of south-eastern London.

Food Dehydration: is the process of removing water from food (usually through evaporation), which in turns prevents the growth of microorganisms and bacteria. **If using dehydrator or oven, pre-heat to 145 degrees for 15-30 minutes prior. **Be sure to check your jerky often. Do not rely on the times given. Oven â lay out the strips on a cookie sheet lined with foil, in rows and a single layer.
Turn the dehydrator on to its maximum setting; typically 155Â°F. Record the temperature once it has stabilized. In order to safely dry meat at home, your oven or dehydrator must be able to maintain a temperature of at least 145Â° to 155Â°F. Do not test the temperature when the dehydrator or oven has product in it.
Fat causes the jerky to spoil much faster. Slice your meat into very thin strips less than 1/20 thick (sometimes a butcher will do this for you for an extra fee if you ask). To make it easier to slice, freeze it for about 5 hours before slicing.
1 Use 3/4 cup of soy sauce, 3.5 oz of liquid smoke, and 1/2 cup of brewed coffee for your marinade. 2  For a vegetarian version of this, try using seitan (wheat protein) or marinated tofu. 3  Try using an oven with a timer, that way you don't sit up all night! 4  Try a soy sauce based marinade.
Dehydrate the meat. Now comes the rewarding part â removing all moisture from your jerky. Using a dehydrator is the standard way of cooking jerky, although you can use an oven (see Step #3). Leave enough room between pieces to allow air to flow around the meat. Avoid letting the meat separate if possible.
Dried dehydrated meat (jerky) has traditionally been made by drying meat at low temperatures (140Â°F â 170Â°F) for a long period of time. These processing conditions can make it difficult to assure a safe end result, including using a home dehydrator.
Marinate the meat (optional). Use a solution of olive oil and vinegar sea salt, or a recipe of your preference. If you choose to marinate the meat, place in the refrigerator for 10 - 24 hours so that the beef can absorb the flavor.
I am making beef jerky. My dehydrator goes up to 160F. I know the safe doneness level for beef is 145, so I don't want to go over that, but most recipes say 160.

Cook at 200 degrees for 1 hour with indirect heat. If your grill cannot be held at this low temperature, cook for smoke flavor for about 20 minutes and then finish in the oven. Dehydrator â Use a dehydrator with a built-in electric heater and fat. This allows fast, even drying with little risk of food spoilage. Look for a unit with a fan and a thermostat for best results. Cook at 140 degrees anywhere from 6-18 hours rotating trays every hour.
Shelf Life Of Dried Dehydrated Meat Jerky. Dried jerky can be stored for 1 to 2 months at room temperature; in the freezer for 6 months or longer. Vacuum package jerky to extend the shelf life! I store my dehydrated strips in glass âcanningâ jars and use our FoodSaver vacuum seal jar sealer lid attachment on the jars.

If you've been to a health food store recently, you've probably noticed jojoba (pronounced ho-ho-ba) oil lining the shelves. And while the lipid has only recently become popular in the U.S., it's been used to treat dry skin for centuries, especially in Mexico [Source: Zeichner].
Jojoba oil for acne. When considering what to use for acne, jojoba oil can prove helpful. In fact, the main use for jojoba oil is for home acne treatments. Jojoba oil is not only great for removing pimples and blackheads, but it can be applied directly to the skin to help curb breakouts.
A 2002 study from the National Research Council notes that acne treatments containing jojoba extract can slow the outbreak of acne. In that study, the researchers found that this conclusion was very likely based on the fact that jojoba oil mimics your skinâs sebum, which brings us to the second use.

Properties of Human Body Oil. Human skin secretes a natural oil, known as sebum, to protect and lubricate the skin and hair. According to a 2001 report from pharmacy researchers at Rutgerâs University, âHuman sebum is a mixture of triglycerides, fatty acids, wax esters, sqalene, cholesterol and cholesterol esters.â.
When applied directly to the skin, jojoba oil has been known to help with acne, psoriasis, sunburn and chapped skin [Source: Levine]. Because it also has cleansing and moisturizing properties, it's often used in shampoos, cleansing products, and face and body lotions [Source: Levine].
Jojoba oil is rich in natural fats that mimic those in the outer layer of the skin, explains Joshua Zeichner, M.D., director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. This means it can help the skin retain moisture and heal itself..
Use massage. Massage can help ease tense muscles and give temporary relief, and it may help you sleep better. First, take a hot bath or shower to relax the muscles. Then, have your partner use oil or lotion and rub your neck and shoulders using the fingers to apply gentle pressure in small circular motions.
Moving around to the side and back of the neck, the outer muscles originate at the base of the skull or the vertebrae of the neck and insert down at the scapula. These muscles help support and move your head and neck.
While most cases of simple muscle strain can be handled with home remedies, some types of neck pain should be checked by a doctor. 1  Your pain is or may be the result of an injury. 2  Your neck pain is accompanied by fever, headache, and muscle aches.  You have tingling or numbness in your arms or hands.
Ice it. Ice effectively numbs pain and decreases inflammation. Put crushed ice in a plastic bag and cover the bag with a pillowcase (a terry towel is too thick to effectively transmit the cold). Apply the icepack to your painful neck for 15 minutes at a time.
And remember, these are just some of the main muscles of your face, neck and back, and, unlike your arms and legs, which are all appendicular muscles, the muscles of the back include both axial and appendicular muscles. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member.

Get rid of that pain in the neck by heeding the home remedies that follow. Take a load off. One of the simplest ways to relieve the pain is to lie down and give your neck muscles a chance to recover. But don't use a thick pillow that crimps your neck.
This is another great stretch to use for relieving the tension in your neck. Loosen up by shrugging your shoulders and rotating your head slowly in a circle. To begin the side-to-side stretch, slowly turn your head to the right until you feel your neck muscles tighten. Hold the position for five seconds, then return your head to the starting position. Repeat the stretch for the left side. Do 10 stretches for each side of your neck. You can use your hand during this stretch as well. Place the index and middle finger of your left hand on the left side of your jaw. As you turn your head to the right, press against your jaw to increase the range of the stretch.
These include the buccinator, masseter, temporalis and pterygoid muscles. Below the muscles of your face are neck muscles that help support and move your head. These include the sternocleidomastoid muscles, which flex your neck, move your head from shoulder to shoulder and turn your face from side to side. Moving around to the back, we have axial muscles of the spinal column.

Best Answer: In the US, it is a fringe movement. They believe under the Constitution, they are not citizens of the US, but actually 'sovereign citizens' and not subject to any of the laws of the US. And by that, I mean subject to NO laws. They decide what they will do.
When it comes down to it, gold has served as a measurement for how healthy the U.S. economy is ever since we went off the gold standard under FDRâs presidency in 1933. When the economy and U.S. dollar are rallying, gold sinks. When the economy and U.S. dollar plummet, gold goes on a tear.
The Sovereign Society is not a part of the sovereign-citizen fringe. We do not advocate any form of violence against any elected official or officers of the law. The Society does not advise members to disavow the tax system or to seek ways to illegally avoid taxation.
60 Minutes not only libeled The Sovereign Society, it belittled our readers and every American who shares our view that the best government is a limited government, and that the pursuit of personal liberty and free-market economics is a noble cause. Now more than ever, stay Sovereign. Jeff D. Opdyke.
Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. J MacNab is one of the nationâs leading experts on Sovereign Citizens, Tax Protesters, U.S. paramilitary âmilitiaâ groups, and related anti-government extremist organizations. She is a Fellow at the George Washington University Center for Cyber & Homeland Security, Program on Extremism.
The short answer: a sovereign citizen is someone who believes that he or she is above all laws. The long answer is a bit more complex. Think about a law you donât like. Any law, at any level of government. It can be a big law, like paying income taxes, or a tiny one, like licensing your pet Chihuahua with the county.
For individuals, the best way to reduce your tax burden is to relocate to a tax haven such as Panama or Uruguay. Of course, there are other opportunities to stash your cash away from the governmentâs reach through entities such as an offshore bank account, an offshore LLC or an offshore annuity.
Sovereigns believe that they get to decide which laws to obey and which to ignore, and they don't think they should have to pay taxes. The strange subculture of the sovereign citizens movement, whose adherents hold truly bizarre, complex antigovernment beliefs, has been growing at a fast pace since the late 2000s. Sovereigns believe that they get to decide which laws to obey and which to ignore, and they don't think they should have to pay taxes.
This is a great question, because there really are several ways to invest in gold, but not all of them are equal. First, donât invest in the gold ETF. For starters, it doesnât put the physical metal in your hand, and itâs too disconnected from the actual production process.

A passenger-only edition costs $6 billion. Musk says it will take 20 years to build. So here's how he gets to $20. ...transporting 7.4 million people each way and amortizing the cost of $6 billion over 20 years gives a ticket price of $20 for a one-way trip for the passenger version of Hyperloop. Here's the rundown, via his explanatory .pdf.
The company that landed this âdeal of a lifetime,â was called ECOtality (NASDAQ: ECTY). With close ties to Washington, the news wasn't necessarily a big surprise. It also helped that back in 2009, ECOtality was ahead of the curve on marketing its technology. As a result, what was once little more than a $2 tech stock soared to $18.60 a share.
Not to be confused with Hyperloop One. Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, also known as HTT, is an American research company formed using a crowd collaboration approach (a mix of team collaboration and crowdsourcing) to develop a transportation system based on the Hyperloop concept, which was envisioned by Elon Musk in 2013. 1 History.
The Hype on the Hyperloop - Presented by: The Aol. On Network. Like a scene out of the popular show Futurama- with people transported by giant tubes- Elon Musk's idea for what he has dubbed the Hyperloop is a solar-powered city-to-city elevated transit system. People would ride in aluminum pods inside steel tubes and travel up to 800 miles per hour.
(The ultimate price will be in the billions. Musk has said the California Hyperloop could cost $6 billion to $7.5 billion.) If everything goes according to plan, the Eastern Europe project should be finished by 2020, Wired reports.
AECOM was hired by Musk himself to build the Hyperloop test track. 1  There is a fairly risk-proof way that you can invest in Elon Muskâs Hyperloop high-speed transportation system right now. You can buy stock in AECOM (NYSE:ACM) - the American engineering, construction, consulting, construction management and design firm.
Fortune 500 Company Involved in Hyperloop. AECOM is not a startup, it is a Fortune 500 company that trades on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol: ACM. It also trades on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol E6Z. The company is also highly respected.
The hyperloop is basically a passenger tube that shoots capsules in a low vacuum environment, reaching speeds of 760 mph. In essence, passengers are moved like a puck on an air hockey table, except in a controlled environment that has the ability to slow down and speed up as needed.
Would You Invest in the Hyperloop? - Real Time Insight. Elon Musk is no stranger to game-changing ideas. The visionary was behind PayPal, then one of the first attempts at commercial space travel with SpaceX, as well as CEO of market darling Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) , the surging electric car maker. However, his latest idea could very easily top them all, and revolutionize transportation as we know it, the hyperloop.
Now, as much as I love Tesla... and as much as I believe CEO Elon Musk is one the smartest people on the planet... I'm not suggesting you run out and buy shares of Tesla. That was something I did a couple of years ago, and I'm hoping you took that advice.

There was another side to Andrew Jackson. He was a man who engaged in duels, killing Charles Dickinson in 1806. During in the First Seminole War he inflicted harsh discipline on his troops, including executions for mutiny. The necessity of some were questioned.
The press declared him a hero and dubbed him âOld Hickoryâ. He went on to serve as Governor of the newly acquired Territory of Florida. He ran for President in 1824, winning the popular vote but losing the Electoral College. He ran again in 1828 and won and 4 years later won reelection.
Andrew Jackson, our seventh President of the United States, is a rather acceptable President. He was considered as the People's President, he was very straight forward and h â¦ onest to his people. He takes his job seriously and is probably the most liberal president in history. His presidency however was neither a hero nor a villain, but shared a fair amount of each.
As a War Veteran, Andrew Jackson had served his country. However, Iâve never been particularly fond of him as a President due to his position on slavery. Mr. Schultz, thank you for this reasonable essay. Yes, he was a hero because heâs the only American citizen to have an historical age named for him.

Cat eye color is somewhat variable, especially in the first stage of development. However, feline eye color changes may also indicate serious health concerns that warrant medical attention. Consequently, it is important to understand when and why a catâs eye color may change.
Melanin is a type of pigment that gives color to the eyes, skin, and hair. The amount of melanin in the iris, the colored part of the eye, determines what color a person's eyes will be, says Douglas Fredrick, M.D., a pediatric ophthalmologist at Stanford Children's Health in Palo Alto, California.
Changing Eye Color Later in Life. Once a kittenâs eyes have developed completely, by about 3 months of age, his eyes should be done changing color. If, at this point, you detect any other eye color changes, it may be a sign of eye damage or a serious underlying medical condition. Cases in which a catâs eyes change color dramatically over a short period of time are of particular concern. While changing eye color may indicate a relatively common medical concern such as cat eye infection, it may also suggest the presence of more serious, and potentially fatal, ailments.
Find out why and when your baby's eyes will change color, and how genetics influence baby's physical development. In addition to questions about when baby will sit up, crawl, and walk, many parents ask their doctor about the baby's eye color.
Permanent eye color is not set until a baby is at least nine months old, so wait until your child's first birthday to determine what color they will be. Even then, sometimes you may find little surprises. Subtle color changes can still occur all the way up until about three years of age.
Typically, you'll see the biggest change in the first 6 to 9 months of life, Dr. Moorjani says. Over several weeks or months, you may notice your baby's eyes getting darker. The change is so gradual that you may not notice until, one day, the baby wakes up and surprises you with a different eye color!
Updated July 27, 2016. Baby eye color is likely to change over time. Baby eye color is determined by a substance called melanin. Melanin is a dark pigment contained in the iris, the structure that controls how much light is allowed into the eye. The color of the iris is determined by the amount of melanin in the iris.
Babies with darker skin are usually born with dark eyes that stay relatively dark. Iris color in lighter-skinned babies is usually a blue or bluish-gray color at birth, then change as they grow. Melanin production changes during the first year of life, usually resulting in a darker, deeper eye color.
By 12 months, most babies will have their permanent eye color, although Dr. Fredrick says that some children's eye color may still change up until age 6, though this occurrence is rare and the change won't happen overnight. Super Fun Baby Toys to Keep Baby Stimulated.
Babies' eyes change color about six to nine months after birth. This is usually when melanin production starts inside the eyeball. A one year old with darkly pigmented eyes might have been born with blue eyes. Eye color change in babies is usually from a lighter to darker shade. Don't expect your baby's brown eyes to change back to a blue â it most likely will not happen naturally. The amount of melanin in the eye is determined by genetics.

As per the Constitution Acts of 1867 and 1982, Canada is a constitutional monarchy, wherein the role of the reigning sovereign is both legal and practical, but not political.
Population: In 2006, the population of Canada was estimated to have exceeded 32.6 million. However, Canadians are spread over a large geographic land mass, giving Canada one of the smallest population density ratios in the world at 3.1 persons per square kilometre.
Most people know that the government is a person, or group of people that run and control a country. Of course, like many things in life, there are different approaches to governing a country, from communism to democracy and everywhere in between.
In Canadian English, the word government is used to refer both to the whole set of institutions that govern the country (as in American usage, but where Britons would use state), and to the current political leadership (as in British usage, but where Americans would use administration).
In both senses, the construct was established at Confederation âthrough the Constitution Act, 1867 âas a federal constitutional monarchy, wherein the Canadian Crown acts as the core, or the most basic building block, of its Westminster-style parliamentary democracy.
So, in order to stop this from happening, and making sure that the government acts with the best interests of the people in mind, we have what is called a constitution (Iâll talk more about this later), which is why we are considered constitutional. 2b. Monarchy: Next up is the monarchy. If you live in Canada, you likely know that we recognize the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II, and her representative in Canada, the Governor-General.
4. Federal System: Finally, in Canada we have a federal system. This means that we donât just have a single government with all of the power, but instead the power and responsibility of the government is spread out across 3 levels: federal, provincial and municipal.
The Government of Canada (French: Gouvernement du Canada), formally Her Majesty's Government (French: Gouvernement de Sa Majeste), majestÃ© is the federal administration Of. Canada In Canadian, english the term can mean either the collective set of institutions or specifically The-queen-In. council
The Parliament of Canada, the bicameral national legislature located on Parliament Hill in the national capital of Ottawa, consists of the Queen (represented by the governor general), the appointed Senate (upper house), and the elected House of Commons (lower house).
Canada is a federation, which means powers are shared between federal and provincial governments. Head of Government: Prime Minister. Queen Elizabeth II is Canada's official head of state, and is represented in Canada by the Governor General.

Early symptoms of auditory nerve damage may involve hearing or balance problems as the auditory system communicates information concerning sound and body positioning to the brain. Symptoms include tinnitus, sensorineural hearing loss, dizziness, or vertigo with or without vomiting and nausea.owever, this is not usually the case. Most deaf people have conductive hearing loss due to damage in the middle ear structures. Neural hearing loss due to auditory nerve damage is much less common than conductive hearing loss and is usually irreversible.
Hearing loss usually accompanies damage to the auditory nerve. Hearing loss may vary due to the type of damage and degree. Vertigo is the false feeling that you or the room is spinning even though neither is true.Falls are a risk with vertigo as you attempt to correct this miscommunication of being off balance.owever, this is not usually the case. Most deaf people have conductive hearing loss due to damage in the middle ear structures. Neural hearing loss due to auditory nerve damage is much less common than conductive hearing loss and is usually irreversible.
The auditory nerve is composed of two parts. The cochlea located in the inner ear has tiny nerve cells responsible for transmitting sounds from the middle ear. The second part of the auditory nerve is the auditory nerve also referred to as the vestibulocochlear nerve or the eighth cranial nerve.owever, this is not usually the case. Most deaf people have conductive hearing loss due to damage in the middle ear structures. Neural hearing loss due to auditory nerve damage is much less common than conductive hearing loss and is usually irreversible.

Overview. The auditory nerve is responsible for transmitting sounds from the sensory portions of the ear to the brain. Damage to the auditory nerve can lead to a form of deafness called sensorineural hearing loss.Because this form of hearing loss is caused by nerve damage, it can be especially difficult to treat.verview. The auditory nerve is responsible for transmitting sounds from the sensory portions of the ear to the brain. Damage to the auditory nerve can lead to a form of deafness called sensorineural hearing loss.
Sensorineural hearing loss is hearing loss due to damage to the hair cells of the organ of Corti or to the auditory part of the vestibulocochlear nerve. Tinnitus is ringing or buzzing in the ears. Vertigo is the illusion of movement.Nystagmus is a to-and-fro movement of the eyes.nswer 6-1. It is nearly impossible to cause loss of hearing in one ear by damage to the brain beyond the point where the vestibulocochlear nerve enters the brain stem. This is because the distribution of hearing is bilateral at all levels of the central nervous system auditory pathway.
Sensorineural hearing loss occurs if the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea are damaged, or as a result of damage to the auditory nerve (which transmits sound to the brain).In some cases, both may be damaged. Hearing loss caused by age and exposure to loud noises are both types of sensorineural hearing loss.earing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain.

Copper capacitive sensors can be implemented on standard FR4 PCBs as well as on flexible material. ITO allows the capacitive sensor to be up to 90% transparent (for one layer solutions, such as touch phone screens). Size and spacing of the capacitive sensor are both very important to the sensor's performance.
Many types of sensors use capacitive sensing, including sensors to detect and measure proximity, position or displacement, humidity, fluid level, and acceleration. Human interface devices based on capacitive sensing, such as trackpads, can replace the computer mouse.
A modified material for use with a capacitive touch screen is described. The modified material comprises a material impregnated with a composition comprising either a non-metallic and/or a metallic conductive agent with a binder. A variety of materials are contemplated, including, but not limited to leather.
[0011] The invention is also directed to a method of operating a capacitive touch screen by placing the modified material of the invention in proximity to the touch screen in a manner that allows for operation of the touch screen. [0012] In one embodiment, a glove comprises the modified material described above.
The two most commonly used systems are resistive and capacitive touch screens. For the sake of simplicity, I will focus here on these two systems and finish with where experts think touch screen technology is headed.
How touchscreens work. Different kinds of touchscreen work in different ways. Some can sense only one finger at a time and get extremely confused if you try to press in two places at once. Others can easily detect and distinguish more than one key press at once. These are some of the main technologies:
These screens literally âresistâ your touch; if you press hard enough you can feel the screen bend slightly. This is what makes resistive screens work â two electrically conductive layers bending to touch one another, as in this picture: Resistive touch screen technology [Image Credit: Chassis Plans]
In electrical engineering, capacitive sensing (sometimes capacitance sensing) is a technology, based on capacitive coupling, that can detect and measure anything that is conductive or has a dielectric different from air.
Resistive Touchscreens. The resistive touchscreen is the most common type of touchscreen. Except for modern smartphones, tablets and trackpads, most touchscreens we come in contact with are actually resistive touchscreens. As youâve probably guessed, the resistive touchscreen relies on resistance.
Unlike resistive touch screens, capacitive screens do not use the pressure of your finger to create a change in the flow of electricity. Instead, they work with anything that holds an electrical charge â including human skin.

To ensure a smooth encounter with Spanish customs and border patrol officials, U.S. travelers should bring the proper travel documentation. At a minimum, all U.S. visitors to Spain must hold a valid U.S. passport.
When a Visa is Needed. According to the U.S. Department of State, U.S. citizens visiting Spain for longer than 90 days need to apply for a visa. Travelers planning to study at a university or work during their stay in the Spain also must apply for a visa, even if the visit is shorter than 90 days.
Thatâs right, the Spanish do not believe in restocking toilet paper. I have no idea if they go out TP-ing historic statues at night, or if theyâre stockpiling for the next uprising, but whatever the reason, donât expect to find it in bars, petrol stations, nightclubs, restaurants, etc.
DINERO. First off, travelers checks are not the norm here in Spain. However, if you do bring travelers checks, the best thing to do is to come prepared with the address of your local AmEx office (there is one in the Madrid city center for example).
For more information, click here. â¢ Passports and travel documents are required to be valid during the duration of the visit. You do not need a minimum of validity in your passport or travel document to travel to Spain. â¢ Children included in the parentâs passport must be accompanied by the parent. The childâs right to travel on the passport will lapse depending on the age stipulated by the issuing country and be under 16 years of age.
U.S. Passport. A valid U.S. passport is always required for international travel to and from the United States. If the passport expires before you return to the United States, you will find it difficult to re-enter the country.
Travel documents for EU nationals. Share on: Share on Facebook Tweet it Share on google+ Share on linkedIn E-mail. If you are an EU national, you do not need to show your national ID card or passport when you are travelling from one border-free Schengen EU country to another.
These maps are by far the most helpful and descriptive ones youâll find. Additionally, there are huge discounts on train fares on the Renfe web page for a 14 day or 7 day advance purchase, as well as for 24 hour (last minute) travel on the AVE. Sometimes reductions can go up to 70% !!
Malta. Switzerland. Greece. Netherlands. You must still show a valid ID card or passport when travelling to or from Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland, Romania and the United Kingdom. Though part of the EU, these countries do not belong to the border-free Schengen area.
Verry nice and helpfull work, congratulations. My blog about networking http://howdoesinternetwork.com it's writing also about how exactly internet is working and about all the network fundamentials.. Hope you will enjoy learning from it and help me with some comments and maybe suggestions.
A computer network is a group of computer systems and other computing hardware devices that are linked together through communication channels to facilitate communication and resource-sharing among a wide range of users. Networks are commonly categorized based on their characteristics.
A network is a group of two or more computer systems or other devices that are linked together to exchange data. Networks share resources, exchange files and electronic communications. For example, networked computers can share files or multiple computers on the network can share the same printer.
Techopedia explains Computer Network. One of the earliest examples of a computer network was a network of communicating computers that functioned as part of the U.S. military's Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) radar system.
Newcomers to this field are often bewildered by the substantial wealth of. information already published on the subject. This book is aimed at this group of. people. It provides a broad coverage of the key concepts, techniques, and. terminology, so as to prepare readers for more advanced discussions. In-depth. discussions of technically-involved topics are intentionally avoided in favor of more. general concepts. No previous knowledge of networks or programming is assumed.

This book is concerned with post-computer communication networks and two of its. important streams: data communication and telecommunication. Data communication. refers to the communication between digital computers, facilitated by computer. networks.
There are many types of computer networks. Common types of networks include the following: 1  Local-area network (LAN): The computers are geographically close together (that is, in the same building).  Wide-area network (WAN): The computers are farther apart and are connected by telephone lines or radio waves.
If they are not breathing, or not breathing normally (only gasping), call 911. If you are alone, perform CPR for 2 minutes, then call. 4. Check the carotid pulse on the side of the neck closest to you for 5-10 seconds. 5. If no pulse, begin 30 chest compressions on the lower half of the breastbone with one or two hands.
For a trained lay rescuer, the compressions and breaths should be provided in a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 breaths. Ventilations with advanced airway (HCP): 1 breath every 6-8 seconds (8-10 breaths/min) Asynchronous with chest compressions About 1 second per breath Visible chest rise. 3 people found this useful.
Confidence votes 277. Breathing should be checked for 10 seconds, in that time you should be looking and checking for 3 things: 1- The rising of the chest-which would suggest the casualty is breathing. 2- Listening for breathing by the mouth-not to be confused with the alike sound of gasping in which the body sometimes does when someone is unconscious and not breathing.
It determines the amount of air in your lungs, the amount of air you can inhale into your lungs, and the amount of air you can exhale from your lungs. PFTs measure how much air moves in and out of the lungs.
Follow these steps to check whether an unconscious victim is breathing and to see if they have any signs of circulation: 1. With the victim's airway open, look, listen, and feel for breathing for about 5-10 seconds by placing your cheek near the victim's mouth and watching for their chest to rise and fall. 2. Check the victim for signs of circulation, such as movement, coughing, or groaning. 3. If the victim is not breathing but does show signs of circulation, perform to rescue breathing. If the victim is not breathing and has no signs of circulation, perform to CPR.
3. Check to see if the baby is breathing by looking at their chest. If they are not breathing, or not breathing normally (only gasping), call 911. If you are alone with the baby, perform 5 sets of 30 compressions and 2 breaths, then call.
Give one breath every 6-8 seconds and there should be no pause in chest compressions for delivery of breaths. Rescue Breathing. If an adult, child, or baby has a pulse but is not breathing properly, you should perform rescue breathing (breaths but no compressions).
Lung capacity tests determine the total volume of air in the lung. No matter how hard you blow out, a small volume of air still remains in the lung. This amount of air left in your lungs is what allows you to take in your next breath with ease.
Instructions: Please type in your First and Last Name so we know who is taking the test. Each question has a drop down list to selection your answers. Choose an answer and move on to the next question. Once you are finished. of your answers before submission. All questions must be answered, if you do not, your answers will not be submitted until you complete all questions.
Flow volume loop. The âflow volume loopâ shows how much air you can forcefully exhale (forced vital capacity, or FVC). It also shows how much air is exhaled in the first second of a forced exhalation (forced expired volume in one second, or FEV-1). You will be asked to take a deep breath in and blow out as hard and as fast as you can through a mouthpiece. You will blow out until you feel there is no more air left in your lungs.
Population Regulation of Coral Reef Fishes Populations of reef fish are widely believed to be limited by availability of larval recruits, not by density dependent processes operating during and after settlement of young stages in the reef environment.Our research explores and challenges this thinking.
The most common animals that belong to it are, among vertebrates, many types of fish, reptiles (tortoises and water snakes), sea mammals (whales, dolphins, sperm whales, etc.). They are generally predators, i.e. consumers placed at the end of the food chain, at the top of the ecological pyramid.
Home / Coral Reefs 101 / Coral Reef Ecology / Coral Reef Biodiversity Coral Reef Biodiversity Biodiversity is the variety of living species that can be found in a particular placeâregion, ecosystem, planet, etc. Coral reefs are believed by many to have the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem on the planetâeven more than a tropical rainforest.
Few economic valuations of MNPs are currently available, however a valuation model of anti-cancer drugs alone suggests that a 20% loss of coral reef biodiversity would equate to a market value loss of US$112 billion -1.14 trillion. 1  Around two million species are found in coral reefs.
What is the coral reef ecosystem? The health, abundance and diversity of the organisms that make up a coral reef is directly linked to the surrounding terrestrial and marine environments. Mangrove forests and seagrass beds are two of the most important facets of the greater coral reef ecosystem.
Invasive Species. Marine ecosystems contain many species of plants, animals and microorganisms that have evolved in isolation, separated by natural barriers. Human transportation activities such as shipping and air travel have allowed these species to move beyond their natural ranges into new areas.

Populations of reef fish are widely believed to be limited by availability of larval recruits, not by density dependent processes operating during and after settlement of young stages in the reef environment.Our research explores and challenges this thinking.
Marine invasive species include: Eighty-four percent of the worldâs marine ecosystems are already impacted by invasive species. Biogeographically isolated communities, such as Hawaiiâs ecosystems, are more susceptible to the introduction of invasive species. Not all non-native species will become invasive.
There is another very important element of the reef ecosystem that is often over looked: the land. Pollutants, nutrients and litter enter near shore waters through rivers, streams, underground seepage, waste water and storm water runnoff.
Reefs are also home to a large variety of other organisms, including fish, seabirds, sponges, Cnidarians (which includes some types of corals and jellyfish), worms, crustaceans (including shrimp, cleaner shrimp, spiny lobsters and crabs), molluscs (including cephalopods), echinoderms (including starfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers), sea squirts, sea turtles and sea snakes.
Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer caused by smoking. More than 80% of cases of lung cancer are due to smoking.Cigarette smoke contains many chemicals that interfere with the body's method of filtering air and cleaning out the lungs. The smoke irritates the lungs and leads to overproduction of mucus.ong term exposure of the lungs to the irritants in tobacco smoke destroys the normal lung structure. The elastic walls of the small airways within the lungs are broken down. This reduces the amount of lung tissue available for the transfer of oxygen from the air to the blood.
How smoking causes lung cancer. Doctors believe smoking causes lung cancer by damaging the cells that line the lungs. When you inhale cigarette smoke, which is full of cancer-causing substances (carcinogens), changes in the lung tissue begin almost immediately. At first your body may be able to repair this damage.But with each repeated exposure, normal cells that line your lungs are increasingly damaged.ronchioles and alveoli. Smoking causes the majority of lung cancers â both in smokers and in people exposed to secondhand smoke. But lung cancer also occurs in people who never smoked and in those who never had prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke.
Damage to the respiratory system from cigarette smoking is slow, progressive, and deadly. A healthy respiratory system is continuously cleansed.The mucus produced by the respiratory tubules traps dirt and disease-causing organisms, which cilia sweep toward the mouth, where it can be eliminated.amage to the respiratory system from cigarette smoking is slow, progressive, and deadly. A healthy respiratory system is continuously cleansed.
Damage to the lung tissue is irreversible. Emphysema can be prevented by not smoking, avoiding anything that will irritate the lungs such as dust and cold air, and ensuring any chest infections such as flu and bronchitis are treated properly.ong term exposure of the lungs to the irritants in tobacco smoke destroys the normal lung structure. The elastic walls of the small airways within the lungs are broken down. This reduces the amount of lung tissue available for the transfer of oxygen from the air to the blood.
All lung cancer damages lungs by clotting them and not allowing you to take in a proper amount of air when you breath.this enables you in that you cant do athletic activity's â¦   Lung cancer affects the lungs. In the lungs there is a tumor.But sometimes that tumor can press againest the airways.moking also  damages the alveoli in the lungs, which are small air sacs that  help deliver oxygen into the bloodstream and assist in removing  carbon dioxide when you exhale.
Emphysema is an example of a chronic change. Here is a list of the changes that happen in your lungs and airways when you smoke: 1  The cells that produce mucus in your lungs and airways grow in size and number. 2  As a result, the amount of mucus increases.3  The mucus is also thicker.mphysema is an example of a chronic change.

Secondhand smoke contains many of the same harmful chemicals that people inhale when they smoke. Secondhand smoke can damage the hearts and blood vessels of people who don't smoke in the same way that active smoking harms people who do smoke. Secondhand smoke greatly increases adults' risk of heart attack and death.moking harms nearly every organ in the body, including the heart, blood vessels, lungs, eyes, mouth, reproductive organs, bones, bladder, and digestive organs. This article focuses on how smoking affects the heart and blood vessels.
Long term exposure of the lungs to the irritants in tobacco smoke destroys the normal lung structure. The elastic walls of the small airways within the lungs are broken down.

When these alveoli are damaged, the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide can not occur as efficiently. The damage from cigarette smoke to the alveoli of the lungs can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath after activity, coughing and hacking and susceptibility to lung infections such as pneumonia.moking cigarettes is very bad for your overall health. Awareness of the increased risk of lung cancer involved with smoking cigarettes is high, but smoking cigarettes is bad for the health of your lungs and the rest of your body in multiple ways.
Some of the chemicals in cigarette smoke can cause serious damage to the delicate tissues of the breathing system.

During stress, your body produces some hormones that increase the blood sugar levels, and at the same time, they inhibit the insulin function. As a consequence, youâll have high blood sugar levels, which will help you face your âstress situationâ. On the other hand, these levels can reach the highest peak (uncontrollable), and then, they are considered as dangerous high blood glucose level.
1 Consume 15-20 grams of glucose or simple carbohydrates. 2  Recheck your blood glucose after 15 minutes. 3  If hypoglycemia continues, repeat.  Once blood glucose returns to normal, eat a small snack if your next planned meal or snack is more than an hour or two away.
1 The doctor tests your blood sugar levels after fasting for 8 hours and itâs higher than 126 mg/dL.  Oral glucose tolerance test. After fasting for 8 hours, you get a special sugary drink. Two hours later your sugar level is higher than 200.
If you are asking what blood glucose level is considered dangerous; then, you should know that it all depends on your current health situation. However, the dangerous sugar levels, where the symptoms of hypoglycemia will occur, are considered those less than 40 mg/dL. Shaking, nausea, tremors, sweating or increased heart palpitations are some symptoms to recognize your blood sugar is dropping.

Keeping your body fueled requires sugar in the bloodstream and insulin, which is created in the pancreas. Insulin regulates your blood sugar, or glucose. Blood sugar levels that are higher than normal can have serious long-term effects on your health, but low blood sugar levels can quickly become a medical emergency. Carbohydrates supply the body with blood glucose.
Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Glucose) Hypoglycemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low blood glucose (blood sugar) levels, usually less than 70 mg/dl. However, it is important to talk to your health care provider about your individual blood glucose targets, and what level is too low for you.
They're less than 100 mg/dL after not eating (fasting) for at least 8 hours. And they're less than 140 mg/dL 2 hours after eating. During the day, levels tend to be at their lowest just before meals. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/dL. For some people, 60 is normal; for others, 90.
Therefore, it is compulsory to check for any dangerous levels, especially after having your exercise or taking your drugs, as most probably an episode of low blood glucose will occur (usually within the first 2 hours after taking the diabetic drugs).
In a healthy adult, normal blood sugar levels range from 70 mg/dl to 130 mg/dl, and up to 180 mg/dl after eating a meal. Causes. At the metabolic level, hypoglycemia results from too little glucose in the blood or too much insulin.
Random check. The doctor tests your blood sugar and itâs higher than 200, plus youâre peeing more, always thirsty, and youâve gained or lost a significant amount of weight. Heâll then do a fasting sugar level test or an oral glucose tolerance test to confirm the diagnosis.

The potential of NADH and FADH 2 is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation.
If you're talking about aerobic cellular respiration (and you probably are), then it's 36 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Anaerobic respirati â¦ on, otherwise known as fermentation, consists only of glycolysis and yields 2 ATP per glucose molecule. By and large, aerobic is much more efficient.
Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the cytosol of cells in all living organisms. This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen. In humans, aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate.
In Plants 1) photosynthesis creates glucose molecules (instead of eating) â 2) this fuels cellular respiration in the plant cells â 3) creates ATP â 4) fuels plant growth and reproduction â 5) provides carbohydrates to animals for their cellular respiration. The cycle continues.
This process starts in the cellsâ cytoplasm and is completed in the mitochondria-the cellular powerhouse. In those tiny organelles, one molecule of glucose with 6 molecules of oxygen are changed into 36 molecules of ATP â the energy cells can use to get things done. Cellular respiration is going on in every cell in both animals and plants.
Oxidative phosphorylation is the step of cellular respiration that  produces the most ATP. The process that uses energy stored in a  hydrogen ion gradient across a membrane â¦ to drive ATP synthase is  chemiosmosis.
The organelle which produces Adenosine Tri-Phosphate in both plants and animals is the mitochondrion or, more accurately, mitochondria because there are usually many of them i â¦ n each cell. In plants, the other organelle which produces its own ATP from sunlight is the Chloroplast. 2 people found this useful.
Cellular respiration is the set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.
Starting with glucose, 1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase. During energy metabolism, glucose 6-phosphate becomes fructose 6-phosphate.
In that case, the organism can still create energy, but through the process of fermentation. Fermentation happens in the cellsâ cytoplasm (not in the mitochondria) and helps generate only 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule (much less effective in generating energy than cellular respiration). Fermentation uses the pyruvate molecules made by glycolysis from glucose.

RE: Krylon spray paint area coverage? If I was just spraying a flat surface like paper, how much area can a can of Kryon multi-purpose paint cover?
The paint can gives you an estimate of square footage or something or other. That was useless to me. When I'm thinking of what I'm painting, for example, two lamps or a picture frame, then a square footage doesn't help me out. Actually, there's some brands that don't even give you an estimate. Anyways, so I thought I'd give you an example of what one spray paint can might do for you.
Unless of course you are painting something large like a floor or a wall. For use of a can of Rustoleum brand spray paint, like this: {As you can see, there are many different brands. I use all of them, though I really do prefer Rustoleum coverage. Although, the Tremclad (which is oddly, owned by Rustoleum..

You Can Rise Again! Lakewood Church | by Joel and Victoria Osteen. When Jesus was on His way to be crucified, He was made to carry His own cross. He had been so beaten down that He couldn't carry it all the wayâHe fell down under the weight of His cross. Sometimes in life, the cross we're carrying can get heavy.
Lakewood took out a 30-year lease on the property â which formerly served as home court for the Houston Rockets, first as the Houston Summit, and later as the Compaq Center â in 2001. Lakewood prepaid the entire $11.8 million lease amount, then spent more than $80 million to turn the former basketball arena into a proper TV-worthy megachurch.
Compaq (a portmanteau of Compatibility And Quality; occasionally referred to as CQ prior to its final logo) was a company founded in 1982 that developed, sold, and supported computers and related products and services.
Joel Osteen, pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, and the bestselling author of books like Your Best Life Now and I Declare: 31 Promises to Speak Over Your Life, has been dubbed the smiling preacher due to his toothy smile and upbeat attitude.

In diabetic neuropathy, the symptoms will usually develop in the feet first and then go up the legs. About two-thirds of diabetic people usually have some degree of damage done to their nerves.
Wearing tight shoes or sitting on your foot can give you a numb foot or leg or cause pins and needles. This kind of numbness has an obvious cause, gets better when the pressure is removed and doesn't cause any further problems.
Pins and needles usually happen when weight applied to a part of the body cuts off the blood supply to the nerves in that area. For example, kneeling often causes pins and needles by limiting the blood supply to the nerves in your lower legs.
The most common cause of pins and needles is a moderately pinched nerve. Pins and needles is referred to as paraesthesia in the medical community. Did you know that feeling pins and needles can actually be a worse sign than having pain in your arm or leg. This is because the nerve is squashed so much that you can't even feel pain anymore. Even worse than pins and needles is numbness or anaesthesia , which is a total lack of sensation. You will experience anaesthesia when there is severe nerve compression. Anaesthesia or numbness that persists for more than a few hours can be sign of permanent nerve compression.
Certain health conditions may also damage your nervous system and lead to pins and needles in hands and feet. These may include multiple sclerosis, stroke, and brain tumor. Other Causes. You may also experience burning, tingling sensation in your hands and feet for several other causes.
Paraesthesia. Pins and needles (also known as paraesthesiae) is a cold, burning, prickling or tingling sensation that is usually felt in the arms, legs, hands or feet. It can also happen in other parts of the body, such as the mouth and neck. The sensation is normally painless and can cause numbness or itching.
Common Causes of Pinched Nerves. The most common forms of nerve compression are in the spinal joints where either a disc bulge or a bony arthritic spur can irritate and compress the nerve. Compressions can also occur as the nerve passes through or around muscles. Your physiotherapist will know where to look.
Pins and needles in feetis a burning, pricking, or numbing sensation. You may experience the same sensation in your hands, legs, or arms as well. You don't usually experience any pain, but it may lead to itching. The sensation is usually temporary, but you may sometimes experience constant pins and needles in feet. It is important to find out the underlying cause to be able to treat it.

Then a z-score tells us how many standard deviations our sample is from that normal or most frequent value. Therefore, the z-score can tell us if the economy grew a lot ( z-scores > 2) or if a group that is sick has high temperatures (again a z-score > 2). Then what does a negative z-score tell us? That the sample was below the normal or most frequent value! So during the Great Recession the economy shrank.
The standard score of a raw score x is. where: The absolute value of z represents the distance between the raw score and the population mean in units of the standard deviation. z is negative when the raw score is below the mean, positive when above. A key point is that calculating z requires the population mean and the population standard deviation, not the sample mean or sample deviation.
Some common standard scores and their corresponding mean and standard deviation are: ACT scores (18 and 5), SAT scores (500 and 100), T-scores (50 and 10), and z-scores (0.0 and 1.0). A positive standard score indicates a datum above the mean, while a negative standard score indicates a datum below the mean. It is a dimensionless quantity obtained by subtracting the population mean from an individual raw score and then dividing the difference by the population standard deviation.
Your calculated z-score would be negative. Here is an example: 25% of pregnancies in the US are delivered by Cesarean by doctors. We know that this type of surgery increases recovery time and risks of infection for the mother. So we would really like to reduce that number.
The chart shows the values of negative z scores which is either to the left or below the mean value. The whole number and the first digit after the decimal point of the z score is displayed in the row and the second digit in the column of the normal distribution table.
What is a 'Z-Score'. A Z-score is a numerical measurement of a value's relationship to the mean in a group of values. If a Z-score is 0, it represents the score is identical to the mean score. Z-scores may also be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean. Positive and negative scores also reveal the number of standard deviations the score is either above or below the mean. Next Up.
The absolute value of the z-score tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean. If a z-score is equal to 0, it is on the mean. If a Z-Score is equal to +1, it is 1 Standard Deviation above the mean. If a z-score is equal to +2, it is 2 Standard Deviations above the mean.
Well to find the z-score we need the standard deviation. #s.d. = sqrt(((.25)(.75))/100) = .043#. then the z-score is: #z = (.20 - .25)/.043 = -1.16#. so the sample is 1.16 standard deviations below the normal rate of Cesareans by 1.16 deviations.
In the visual system, retinal, technically called retinene 1 or retinaldehyde, is a light-sensitive molecule found in the rods and cones of the retina. Retinal is the fundamental structure involved in the transduction of light into visual signals, i.e. nerve impulses in the ocular system of the central nervous system. In the presence of light, the retinal molecule changes configuration and as a result a nerve impulse is generated. Optic nerve
The information about the image via the eye is transmitted to the brain along the optic nerve. Different populations of ganglion cells in the retina send information to the brain through the optic nerve. About 90% of the axons in the optic nerve go to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus.
Transmission of a nerve impulse along an axon. A nerve cell is like a receiver, transmitter and transmission line with the task of passing a signal along from its dendrites to the axon terminal bundle. The stimulus triggers an action potential in the cell membrane
The dendrites serve as the stimulus receptors for the neuron, but they respond to a number of different types of stimuli. The neurons in the optic nerve respond to electrical stimuli sent by the cells of the retina. Other types of receptors respond to chemical neurotransmitters. The cell body contains the necessary structures for keeping the neuron functional.
Layers four and six (4 & 6) of the LGN also connect to the opposite eye, but to the P cells (color and edges) of the optic nerve. By contrast, layers two, three and five (2, 3, & 5) of the LGN connect to the M cells and P (parvocellular) cells of the optic nerve for the same side of the brain as its respective LGN.

At the terminal end of the axon is a branched structure with ends called synaptic knobs. From this structure chemical signals can be sent to neighboring neurons. Transmission of nerve impulse along the axon
The visual system is the part of the central nervous system which gives organisms the ability to process visual detail, as well as enabling the formation of several non-image photo response functions. It detects and interprets information from visible light to build a representation of the surrounding environment.
A: When light reaches the rods and cones in the retina at the back of the eyeball, a series of complex chemical reactions takes place, forming the chemical rhodopsin that converts the light into electrical impulses, according to the Vision for Tomorrow Foundation. The electrical impulses travel to the optic nerve.
The optic nerve, which is a collection of retinal nerve fibers, conducts the electrical impulses to the optic chasm of the brain, according to the Vision for Tomorrow Foundation. Half of the retinal nerve fibers from each retina's inner half cross to the other side of the brain. The nerve fibers meet at the occipital lobe in the back of the brain. Vision is interpreted by the brain in the primary visual cortex. Each rod and cone, which are photoreceptors, in the retina is connected to the optic nerve by a tiny nerve branch, according to the Merck Manual Home Edition.
We know all about what the women on The Bachelor do for a living, (how can you forget Tiara, the Chicken Enthusiast?) but what's the occupation of the show's star? Besides being a Perfect Ben, and charming women nationwide with his wit, looks, and gentlemanly persona, what does Ben Higgins do for a living? Higgin's a business analyst.

5 Facts To Know About 'Bachelorette' Desiree. While Bachelor Sean Lowe announced on Monday that he found love with Catherine Giudici, his former flame Desiree Hartsock announced that her road to romance is just beginning.
There was a cast member on a season of The Bachelorette a few years back who had no real job. He lived in rural Colorado and spent his days living off the land. He was a hunter, a fisher. We discussed at length what his chyron should read. Ultimately, we went with âoutdoorsman,â which we quite liked.
Desiree's life reads like a Katherine Heigl romantic comedy. Not only is she the new Bachelorette, but the 26-year-old currently works as a bridal stylist in Colorado.
Some of the job titles arenât even jobs at all! [In those cases] who they are is defined less by [how] they make a living and more by some other dominant trait. Haley and Emily [Ferguson], the twins from Benâs season, are a good example.
For decades, MenB has been the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the UK and Ireland. Today, meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia remain the leading infectious cause of death for children under five in the UK.

Do not peel or remove stems. Cover figs with water and boil 2 minutes. Drain. Gently boil figs in light syrup (1 cup sugar to 4 cups water) for 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons bottled lemon juice per quart or 1 tablespoon per pint to the jars.
- Figs are rich in potassium and fiber, helping to stabilize the blood pressure of the body. Figs contain anti-diabetic and anti-tumor properties. They have calcium, potassium, and soluble fiber, which aids in the reduction of cholesterol. - Figs promote good sleeping habits and protect the person against insomnia.
Besides these vitamins, the figs also contain folic acid, sodium and zinc. Benefits of Figs : - Figs are rich in potassium and fiber, helping to stabilize the blood pressure of the body. Figs contain anti-diabetic and anti-tumor properties.
No where can I find a processing time for pressure canning figs. I find numerous sources advising this, but none with processing times... I really would rather not add lemon juice and process by BWB-these taste perfect as is. Previously I spaced and processed several quarts BWB method-then I realized they were low acid.
Therefore, if they are to be canned as acid foods, these products must be acidified to a pH of 4.6 or lower with lemon juice or citric acid. Properly acidified tomatoes and figs are acid foods and can be safely processed in a boiling-water canner.
The Whoodle exhibits a coat that combines the appearance of the Poodleâs curly coat and the Soft Coated Wheaton Terrierâs long, silky coat. The Whoodleâs coat may be either wavy or straight and it comes in a variety of colors including black, red, chocolate, apricot, silver, or parti (spotted).
The Whoodle is a cross between the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier and the Poodle which comes in three sizes â toy, miniature, and standard. The Whoodle, then, also comes in three sizes â miniature, medium, and standard.
The Whoodle is an intelligent, loving, companion that is easily trained. We do recommend that all puppies, regardless of breed, go through basic dog training. The little bundle of fur puppy does grow up to be an adult and what is cute in a puppy might not be so tolerable in an adult. It is important to train your puppy early so that you will have a perfect Whoodle for life.
The Whoodle is a hybrid breed, a cross between the Standard Poodle and the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier. Because the Poodle comes in three sizes (toy, miniature, and standard), the Whoodle also comes in three sizes â miniature, medium, or standard. The Whoodle comes in three different sizes so you should choose a dog food formula appropriate for the dogâs size.
Why a Whoodle Puppy For You? Although we love Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers, due to their strong willed terrier instinct, they do not make the best pet for the average dog lover. Mixing the breed with a Standard Poodle dilutes the Terrier and adds intelligence. Both breeds are hypo-allergenic.
The Whoodle is not recognized by the AKC because it is technically a hybrid of two pure breeds rather than a new breed. This breed is, however, recognized by the American Canine Hybrid Club, the Designer Dogs Kennel Club, the International Designer Canine Registry, and the Designer Breed Registry.
Happiness Is Pets is a member of the Chicago Better Business Bureau and have their highest A+ rating!
Mix: Â½ Soft Coated Wheaton Terrier & Â½ Poodle. Size: Most commonly bred with the standard size Poodle, but may also be bred with the miniature size Poodle. Size can range from 25 â 40 pounds. Coat: Coats are soft and long and can be straight, or wavy.
A Whoodle (also known as Swheat-n-poo, or Sweatenpoo) is a mix between the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier and most commonly the Standard Sized Poodle, but may also be bred with the miniature Poodle. They range in size from approximately 25 â 45 pounds.
Hi, we have sent a friend request thru Facebook so we can be updated on the progress of the litter. I do have one question for you. I didnât realize there was such a range of size of Whoodles.
Xslx is excel work sheet file. It could contains much more than just raw data (chart, formating document, etc...) In case you only need to store raw data(only rows and columns) csv is usually prefered though the size of xlsx is smaller.
The difference between CSV and XLS file formats is that CSV format is a plain text format in which values are separated by commas (Comma Separated Values), while XLS file format is an Excel Sheets binary file format which holds information about all the worksheets in a file, including both content and formatting.
.xlsx contains all the information needed to make the Excel file look the way it does, including not just data, but formatting, cell widths, cell wrapping, etc. (A .xlsm can contain even more, because that can contain macros as well.) .csv contains two things only.
XLSX and CSV serve different purposes. XLSX is mainly for Excel operations, much beyond plain data. You have formulas, formats, pivot tables, charts, and VBA code in it. Itâs not designed as a common data format for further data manipulation outside of Excel, although other tools can read plain data from it.
In .csv only the values from within your worksheet are stored. No formulas, no styling, just values. In .xlsx your data is stored in the native Excel format, which means that also your formulas and cell and value styles are preserved when you open...

The flow is the same whether the system pressure is low or high, so long as the difference between the inlet and outlet pressures is the same. This equation shows the relationship: The water flow graphs (pages 8 and 9) show water flow as a function of pressure drop for a range of C v values.
There must be flow to the primary circuit for this type of valve to function-if the primary circuit is blocked, the valve will cut off flow to the secondary circuit. Pressure-compensated, variable flow valves-This flow control is equipped with an adjustable variable orifice placed in series with a compensator.
Effects of Temperature Temperature usually is ignored in liquid flow calculations because its effect is too small. Temperature has a greater effect on gas flow calculations, because gas volume expands with higher temperature and contracts with lower temperature.
Flow-control valves. The purpose of flow control in a hydraulic system is to regulate speed. All the devices discussed here control the speed of an actuator by regulating the flow rate. Flow rate also determines rate of energy transfer at any given pressure.
For a valve, we also need to know the pressure drop and the fluid density. But in addition to the dimensions of pipe diameter and orifice size, we need to know all the valve passage dimensions and all the changes in size and direction of flow through the valve.
Control of flow rate with valves. There are eight types of flow-control valves: Orifices-A simple orifice in the line, Figure 1(a), is the most elementary method for controlling flow. (Note that this is also a basic pressure control device.) When used to control flow, the orifice is placed in series with the pump.
In this article. A leaky heart valve might go unnoticed. Or it could cause health problems that could be either minor or serious. How serious a leaky heart valve is depends on how much it interferes with normal blood flow through the heart. Treatments include medicines, surgical repair, or surgical replacement of the leaky valve. Observation over time for changes is the most common approach to a leaky heart valve.
Symptoms of a Leaky Heart Valve. Frequently, a leaky heart valve causes no symptoms. Many healthy people have one or more valves that are slightly leaky. If the heart valve leak is severe, it may impair the forward flow of blood.
Only if the specific gravity of the liquid is very low or very high will the flow change by more than 10 percent from that of water. The effect of specific gravity on gases is similar. For example, the specific gravity of hydrogen is 93 percent lower than that of air, but it changes flow by just 74 percent. Carbon dioxide has a specific gravity 53 percent higher than that of air, yet it changes flow by only 24 percent.
Controlling flow of a fluid-power system does not necessarily mean regulating volume per unit of time from a valve. Flow rate can be specified three different ways, so it is important to be aware of how flow is to be specified or measured: Volumetric flow rate, Qv, expressed in units of in.

In the lunar-based Islamic calendar, Eid al-Adha falls on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah and lasts for four days. In the international (Gregorian) calendar, the dates vary from year to year, drifting approximately 11 days earlier each year. Eid al-Adha is the latter of the two Eid holidays, the former being Eid al-Fitr.The basis for the observance comes from the 196th ayah (verse) of Al-Baqara, the second sura of the Quran.ike Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha begins with a Sunnah prayer of two rakats followed by a sermon (khutbah). Eid al-Adha celebrations start after the descent of the Hujjaj, the pilgrims performing the Hajj, from Mount Arafat, a hill east of Mecca.
But the new study concludes the ancestor did migrate. The number of migrating monarchs has plummeted in recent years. Kronforst said while an estimated one billion monarch butterflies migrated to Mexico in 1996, that number stood at about 35 million this past winter.
The range of the monarch is worldwide and while monarch butterflies are not endangered as a species, the migration of the eastern North American population may be an endangered phenomenon. The media consistently reports that the monarch is endangered of becoming extinct and have been criticized for exaggerating.
Monarch butterflies are famous for migrating from the US and Canada to Mexico for the winter. Now a surprising study suggests the species itself also started out in North America some 2 million years ago.
The researchers carried out genome sequences on 92 monarch butterflies from around the world including non-migratory ones as well as on nine butterflies from closely related species. To study the genetic basis for migration, they compared the genetic blueprint of migratory monarchs to those that do not migrate.
Washington â The 3,000-mile (4,800-km) mass migration of monarch butterflies in North America is one of the insect world's fantastic feats, with millions embarking on the arduous journey from as far north as Canada down into Mexico and the California coast each autumn.
Monarch butterfly migration. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) perform annual migrations across North America which have been called one of the most spectacular natural phenomena in the world.
If the monarch butterfly lives west of the Rocky Mountains, then it will hibernate in and around Pacific Grove, California in eucalyptus trees. Monarch butterflies use the very same trees each and every year when they migrate, which seems odd because they arent the same butterflies that were there last year. These are the new fourth generation of monarch butterflies, so how do they know which trees are the right ones to hibernate in?
Similarly, the western populations migrate annually between regions west of the Rocky Mountains including northern Canada and overwintering sites at the coast of California. Monarchs also perform small distance migrations in Australia and New Zealand. There are also some populations, for instance in Florida and the Caribbean, that do not migrate. Recently discovered overwintering sites have been identified in Arizona and northern Florida.
The monarch migration usually starts in about October of each year, but can start earlier if the weather turns cold sooner than that. The monarch butterflies will spend their winter hibernation in Mexico and some parts of Southern California where it is warm all year long.
Well, other butterflies migrate too! There are many other species of butterflies that also migrate. For example, the Painted Lady, Common Buckeye, American Lady, Red Admiral, Cloudless Sulphur, Skipper, Sachem, Question Mark, Clouded Skipper, Fiery Skipper and Mourning Cloak are all butterflies that migrate as well.

1 If teams are tied in a category, each team gets an average of the point total. 2  Example: 2 teams tie for 1st place, each gets 11.5 points [(12+11) / 2 = 11.5]  League standings are updated after each day's games, so it's possible to see your score rise or fall in one or more categories each day.
What is Rotisserie Baseball? Rotisserie Baseball was invented in the early 1980's by a group of guys who love Major League Baseball. Their goal was to find a way, through the use of player statistics, to emulate Major League Baseball.
How it works: You'll play 1 game per stat category, so if your league uses 10 different categories, you'll play 10 games against the same opponent. Win a game by accumulating a higher total than your opponent in the given category. if you end up with the same total, you'll each earn a tie for that game..
Scoring formats for Fantasy Sports leagues. When it comes time to set up your fantasy league, you'll have 5 possible scoring formats to pick from: Rotisserie, Points Only, and 3 variations of Head-to-Head.
Form Your League - First, organize a group of people that want to play. Then, choose a commissioner and give each owner a copy of the rules. The ORBL's constitution is available in a book called Rotisserie League Baseball, and the ADRL's is in a book called How To Win At Rotisserie Baseball. Both books are revised each year and available in paperback at your local bookstore.
Rotisserie: Rotisserie, or Roto, is the most common way to play fantasy baseball. In this scoring type teams are ranked from first to last in each statistical category. Points are then awarded according to the order in each category, and totaled to determine an overall score and league rank.
Head-to-Head: Points: H2H Points is very similar to how fantasy football is played. It allows you to assign a given point value to individual statistic categories (i.e. HR=4, RBI=1, etc.) and each scoring period's winner is determined solely by which team accumulates the most fantasy points versus a single opponent.
Free Standard and Prize-Eligible games have two scoring formats available during league creation: Rotisserie and Head-to-Head: Each Category. These are the most commonly used scoring formats in fantasy baseball. The two formats are defined below. Rotisserie: Rotisserie, or Roto, is the most common way to play fantasy baseball. In this scoring type teams are ranked from first to last in each statistical category. Points are then awarded according to the order in each category, then totaled to determine an overall score and league rank.
In a Points Only League, scoring is cumulative over the course of the entire season. How it works: Each player in your team's starting lineup earns points based on their performance in each of several stat categories. The points your starting players score are added to your daily point total.
Pick the right scoring format for your league. In some formats, points are scored by each of your players separately based on their individual weekly performances. In others, points continuously accumulate across several statistical categories for all your players (either weekly or throughout the entire season).
Participating pretests dictate that you tell respondents that the pretest is a practice run; rather than asking the respondents to simply fill out the questionnaire, participating pretests usually involve an interview setting where respondents are asked to explain reactions to question form, wording and order.
Much of the accuracy and interpretability of the survey results hinge on this pretesting step-which should never be omitted. Pretesting is critical for identifying questionnaire problems. These can occur for both respondents and interviewers regarding question content, skip patterns, or formatting.
Chapter 7 - How to Conduct Pretesting. The systematic checking or pretesting of a questionnaire is central to planning a good survey. As mentioned earlier in this series, the survey sponsors should play a major role in developing the data-collection instruments being proposed-including any testing being done.
The Posttest Only Design With Non-Equivalent Control Groups. Pretest-posttest designs are an expansion of the posttest only design with nonequivalent groups, one of the simplest methods of testing the effectiveness of an intervention. In this design, which uses two groups, one group is given the treatment and the results are gathered at the end.
When conducting an undeclared pretest, you do not tell respondents that it is a pretest. The survey is given just as you intend to conduct it for real. This type of pretest allows you to check your choice of analysis and the standardization of your survey.
Pretest-posttest designs grew from the simpler posttest only designs, and address some of the issues arising with assignment bias and the allocation of participants to groups. One example is education, where researchers want to monitor the effect of a new teaching method upon groups of children.
Pretesting is a broad term that incorporates many different methods or combinations of methods. This pamphlet briefly describes eight suggested techniques that can be used to pretest questionnaires. These techniques have different strengths and weaknesses. They can be invaluable for identifying problems with draft questionnaires and also for evaluating surveys in the field.
However, researchers can still create effective surveys. To determine the effectiveness of your survey questionnaire, it is necessary to pretest it before actually using it. Pretesting can help you determine the strengths and weaknesses of your survey concerning question format, wording and order. There are two types of survey pretests: participating and undeclared.
For many true experimental designs, pretest-posttest designs are the preferred method to compare participant groups and measure the degree of change occurring as a result of treatments or interventions.
This is, by far, the simplest and most common of the pretest-posttest designs, and is a useful way of ensuring that an experiment has a strong level of internal validity. The principle behind this design is relatively simple, and involves randomly assigning subjects between two groups, a test group and a control.
Of the more than 65,000 living species of chordates, about half are bony fish of the class Osteichthyes. The world's largest and fastest animals, the blue whale and peregrine falcon respectively, are chordates, as are humans.t has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. Attempts to produce evolutionary  family trees  give results that differ from traditional classes because several of those classes are not monophyletic. As a result, vertebrate classification is in a state of flux.
There are two invertebrate subphyla: the Urochordata, or tunicates tunicate, marine animal of the phylum Chordata, which also includes the vertebrates.

Chordates are coelomate animals that possess: 1  a supporting rod or notochord; 2  a single hollow dorsal nerve cord; â 3 metameric segmentationâ: division of the body muscles into similar units, known as segments, that are arranged serially one behind the other;hey differ from the invertebrate chordates in possessing 1  : an internal skeleton, including a vertebral column which encloses the nerve cord; 2  a brain enclosed in a skull; 3  a pumping heart and efficient blood circulation.
Chordates form a phylum of creatures that are based on a bilateral body plan, and is defined by having at some stage in their lives all of the following: 1  A notochord, a fairly stiff rod of cartilage that extends along the inside of the body.t has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. Attempts to produce evolutionary  family trees  give results that differ from traditional classes because several of those classes are not monophyletic. As a result, vertebrate classification is in a state of flux.
The current consensus is that chordates are monophyletic, meaning that the Chordata include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, which is itself a chordate, and that craniates' nearest relatives are cephalochordates.t has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. Attempts to produce evolutionary  family trees  give results that differ from traditional classes because several of those classes are not monophyletic. As a result, vertebrate classification is in a state of flux.
All chordates possess four characteristics that define the phylum, although in most species, these characteristics can only be seen during a relatively small portion of the life cycle (and this is often an embryonic or larval stage, when the animal is difficult to observe).ubphylum Urochordata. The most primitive chordates are the tunicates or sea squirts, and closely related groups such as the larvaceans (Appendicularians). In tunicates, the chordate characteristics can be observed only by examining the entire life cycle.
Craniates, one of the three subdivisions of chordates, have distinct skulls-including hagfish, which have no vertebrae. Michael J. Benton comments, craniates are characterized by their heads, just as chordates, or possibly all deuterostomes, are by their tails.t has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates.

One of the most important tests for identifying mineral specimens is the Mohs Hardness Test. This test compares the resistance of a mineral to being scratched by ten reference minerals known as the Mohs Hardness Scale (see table at left). The test is useful because most specimens of a given mineral are very close to the same hardness. This makes hardness a reliable diagnostic property for most minerals. Friedrich Mohs, a German mineralogist, developed the scale in 1812. He selected ten minerals of distinctly different hardness that ranged from a very soft mineral (talc) to a very hard mineral (diamond).
On the punctuation. When you look at graphite, the greasy. Luster is very apparent and is opaque. and shiny gray. Graphite has a. metallic luster, it is shiny dark gray, almost greasy looking in, is softer than. paper. You can easily scratch it with. your fingernail. In fact, it is so soft that. it marks on paper, which is why it is the. major component of pencil at 10 pencil. that is not really lead it is graphite with. a little bit of clay.
You notice the three cubic. cleavage directions that is most. characteristic of Galena, and this is the. way you tell it apart from any other. mineral. It's fairly soft, you can not. scratch it with your fingernail, and. galena will not scratch a penny.
Minerals[edit] The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is based on the ability of one natural sample of mineral to scratch another mineral visibly. The samples of matter used by Mohs are all different minerals. Minerals are pure substances found in nature. Rocks are made up of one or more minerals.
On the Mohs scale, a streak plate (unglazed porcelain) has a hardness of 7.0. Using these ordinary materials of known hardness can be a simple way to approximate the position of a mineral on the scale.
Even though the color looks. bronze or black, the streak is gray, black. Bornite has a hardness about. the same as the hardness of a penny. So sometimes it scratches a penny. and sometimes the penny can scratch. it.
Aragonite is a polymorph of calcite, a mineral that has the same chemical composition as calcite, but has a slightly different crystal structure. For most purposes aragonite and calcite can be considered to be the same mineral. In its crystal form, aragonite tends to have needlelike crystals and lacks calciteâs rhombohedral cleavage. In massive form, it is difficult to distinguish the two minerals in the field, as both react vigorously with cool dilute acid.
Quartz crystals and masses may have the same luster as calcite, but quartz does not exhibit cleavage and will not react with dilute acid. Quartz is also much harder than calcite. It cannot be easily scratched by a nail and quartz will easily scratch a glass plate.
Dolomite is a mineral that most often forms as an alteration of calcite, as magnesium replaces much of the calcium in the crystal structure. Consequently, it is not unusual for the two minerals to occur together. Both minerals exhibit the same well-developed rhombohedral cleavage and have roughly the same hardness.
The feldspar minerals may have the same color and luster as some calcite varieties, but they can be easily distinguished on the basis of their hardness. Unlike calcite, feldspar minerals are harder than glass and cannot be easily scratched by a nail.
In 1973, Simpson got a job at Paramount Pictures. While there, he co-wrote the 1976 film Cannonball, in which he also had a small role. By 1981, he was named president of production at Paramount. Simpson left Paramount in 1982 and forged a partnership with fellow producer Jerry Bruckheimer.

Format: Paperback. High Concept is the biography of one of the most hated men in Hollywood, producer Don Simpson. According to the biography, Simpson was an arrogant, bullying, pig of a man who took controlled what kept people entertained despite having now discernible talents himself. As a biography, the book is disappointing.
Like the little boy has seen the light. Cut from one face in the mirror to another. It is some time late in the night of 18 January or early in the morning of 19 January, 1996. We are in the bathroom of a Bel-Air mansion, and this guy, Don Simpson, is sitting on the john. He seems half asleep. A book slides off his lap - the latest biography of Oliver Stone.

poriomania (pÅrâ³ Ä-Å-mÄnâ² Ä-Ä) [Gr. poreia, walking, + mania, madness]
The Oxford English Dictionary includes two forms of the word: the adjective aporetic, which it defines as to be at a loss, impassable, and inclined to doubt, or to raise objections; and the noun form aporia, which it defines as the state of the aporetic and a perplexity or difficulty.
The text is also useful in that it provides a more precise (although specialized) definition of the concept: any cognitive situation in which the threat of inconsistency confronts us (1).

Answers. Best Answer: Peter S is right. Small and hydrophobic because hydrophobic molecules dissolve easier and the smaller the surface area of the molecules the easier the diffusion of those molecules across the cell membrane. Or faster. Large and hydrophobic molecules would have trouble penetrating the phospholipid bilayer.
Small and nonpolar (hydrophobic) molecules can freely pass through the membrane, but charged ions and large molecules such as proteins and sugars are barred passage. The selective permeability of the cell membrane allows a cell to maintain its internal composition at necessary levels.
Certain compounds important to the functioning of the cell, such as ions, cannot enter the cell through simple diffusion because they cannot pass through the cell membrane. As with water, these substances âwantâ to enter the cell if the concentration gradient demands it. For that reason, cells have developed a way for such compounds to bypass the cell membrane and flow into the cell on the basis of concentration. The cell has protein channels through the phospholipid membrane.
Polar molecules have trouble passing through the nonpolar part of the phospholipid bilayer. Ions require ion channels and is not as easy as those that simply just diffuse through the membrane. Ion channels might require energy, too... Not glucose because those are larger molecules.

There are many different types of channel proteins in your body, and each one will only let specific types of molecules pass through. Just like a house with three doors that go to the back yard-one for your cat, a bigger doggie door for your St. Bernard, and a regular door for people.
What is the role of cholestrol. Gives the membrane of animal cells mechanical stability-fits between fatty acid tails + helps to make the barrier more complete so substances eg. H2O cannot pass easily and directly through the membrane cholesterol also has an important role in keeping the cell membrane fluid.
Move large molecules eg. glucose down conc. gradient Shaped so specific molecule can fit into them at the membrane surface-when the specific molecule fits, the protein changes shape to allow the molecule through to the other side of the membrane.
Nonpolar and small polar molecules can pass through the cell membrane, so they diffuse across it in response to concentration gradients. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are two molecules that undergo this simple diffusion through the membrane. The simple diffusion of water is known as osmosis.
What gives the bilayer some stability. The hydrophilic head group cannot easily pass through the hydrophobic region in the middle of the bilayer-gives stability despite phospholipid molecules not actually bonded togethrer.

Rivera appears as a pudgy child holding hands with Mexico's famous skeleton, La Calavera Catrina, and it's hard to miss the mono-browed Kahlo, dressed distinctively in the indigenous clothing she favoured, standing close behind.
Three days with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera in Mexico City. From the 1920s to the 1950s, the lovers were Mexico's more shocking version of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, with an artistic output as well known as their tumultuous relationship. facebook.
Many works of both Kahlo and Rivera are on display here (along with Russian illustrator, Angelina Beloff, with whom Rivera started living in 1911). Here, too, is a portrait of Rivera's mother, painted by Rivera when he was only 10 years old.
With slim sable brushes, Frida Kahlo painstakingly rendered her bold unibrow and mustache in dozens of self-portraits. This same Frida also shaved three years off her age, claiming 1910 to be the year she was born in Coyoac n, Mexico, instead of 1907.
Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderon, as her name appears on her birth certificate was born on July 6, 1907 in the house of her parents, known as La Casa Azul (The Blue House), in Coyoacan. At the time, this was a small town on the outskirts of Mexico City.
Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her use of bright colors and dramatic symbolism. She frequently included the symbolic monkey. In Mexican mythology, monkeys are symbols of lust, yet Kahlo portrayed them as tender and protective symbols.
Throughout most of her life, however, Frida remained close to her father. The Mexican Revolution began in 1910 when Kahlo was three years old. Later, however, Kahlo claimed that she was born in 1910 so people would directly associate her with the revolution.
A few days before Frida Kahlo died on July 13, 1954, she wrote in her diary: I hope the exit is joyful-and I hope never to return-Frida. The official cause of death was given as pulmonary embolism, although some suspected that she died from overdose that may or may not have been accidental.
Although Frida's work, often fantastic and sometimes gory, has been described as surrealism, she once wrote that she never knew she was a surrealist until Andr Breton came to Mexico and told me I was one.. (The art of Frida Kahlo is a ribbon about a bomb, Breton wrote, admiringly.) However, Frida eschewed labels.
Indeed, for Kahlo, art imitated (her) life. She once said, I paint my own reality.. From the 1920s when they started courting to Kahloâs death in 1954 and Riveraâs death in 1957, the artists churned out hundreds of works, many of which are on display in museums and public spaces across Mexico City.
The term 'Epistemology' was first used by Scottish philosopher James Frederick Ferrier in 1854. However, according to Brett Warren, King James VI of Scotland had previously personified this philosophical concept as the character Epistemon in 1591.
Logic (from the Greek logos, which has a variety of meanings including word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason or principle) is the study of reasoning, or the study of the principles and criteria of valid inference and demonstration.
Historically, philosophy encompassed any body of knowledge. From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, natural philosophy encompassed astronomy, medicine and physics. For example, Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics.
By Branch / Doctrine > Ethics. Introduction. Back to Top. Ethics (or Moral Philosophy) is concerned with questions of how people ought to act, and the search for a definition of right conduct (identified as the one causing the greatest good) and the good life (in the sense of a life worth living or a life that is satisfying or happy).
Both Plato and Aristotle conceived of logic as the study of argument and from a concern with correctness of argumentation. Aristotle produced six works on logic, known collectively as the Organon, the first of these, the Prior Analytics, being the first explicit work in formal logic.
It is the study of meaning, of the principles underlying conduct, thought and knowledge. The skills it hones are the ability to analyse, to question orthodoxies and to express things clearly.

Axiology: the study of value; the investigation of its nature, criteria, and metaphysical status.
Back to Top. Normative Ethics (or Prescriptive Ethics) is the branch of ethics concerned with establishing how things should or ought to be, how to value them, which things are good or bad, and which actions are right or wrong.

I've always had Windows as the host (Primary) OS and Linux as guest, using VirtualBox. 1  Linux in a window - simplest approach: You get a window that is a new computer with linux. It's got network access over NAT, and each machine can't really see each other. Seamless Mode: a VBox feature that boils down to have the linux's background transparent, so you can see (and click) the Windows behind it.
On VMware machines I have Linux installed and now I want to connect to these VMs from host Windows using SSH. I am unable to do so. Are there any specific settings in order to make this work ? Thanks in advance.

Lamps offered at auctions might be trash or may be treasure. The lamp you use daily might also be a valuable item. Determining the worth of any lighting fixture means taking a good look at some obvious clues and doing a bit of research to estimate the value. Don't assume because it's old that it's valuable. The same is true of modern lighting.
In 1854, Walter Hubbard and his brother-in-law Nathaniel Lyman Bradley produced clocks, tables, frames, lamps, and desk sets, primarily made of brass and bronze, in Meriden, Conn. The value is based on the condition of the glass shade and the size of the lamp. The shade appears to be intact, and the lamp is a nice size.

In criminal law, a misdemeanor is a lesser type of crime that is usually punished by a monetary fine and/or a short jail sentence of less than one year. A misdemeanor is a criminal offense that is less serious than a felony, but more serious than an infraction. Many jurisdictions set different classes of misdemeanors: high or gross misdemeanors, regular misdemeanors, and petty misdemeanors. Common examples of misdemeanors include petty theft offenses, public intoxication, trespassing, displaying or distributing obscene materials, false imprisonment, stalking, and simple assault.
What Are the Different Classes of Misdemeanor Offenses? Most states classify misdemeanors into four of five subcategories, according to the degree of severity of the offense. For example, misdemeanors are usually classified as Class 1 through 4 or Class A through D. Class 1 or Class A is usually the most serious type of offense and is associated with greater penalties.

For example, punishments for misdemeanors will generally look like the following: 1  Class 1 or A: Fines of up to $5,000, and/or a jail sentence of up to 12 months. 2  Class 2 or B: Fines up to $1,000, and/or a jail sentence of 6-9 months. 3  Class 3 or C: Fines up to $1,000 and/or a jail sentence of up to 3 months.
What Is the Difference Between a Misdemeanor and a Felony? The main difference between misdemeanors and felonies is the type of penalty that is associated with each. Misdemeanors only result in jail sentences for a maximum of one year. The sentence for a misdemeanor will usually be served in a local or county jail. On the other hand, a felony charge may result in imprisonment for greater than one year. The sentence will be served in a prison facility rather than a county jail.

Ants are skinny insects. Like their relatives the wasps, they have a narrow connection between their abdomen and thorax. They have chewing mouthparts, and their antennae are bent in the middle. Some ant species are very tiny (1-2mm long), but some tropical species are very large (30 mm).
Ants live in colonies where one or a few females, called queens, lay all the eggs. Most of the queens' offspring become worker ants that do not reproduce. A few are males, and some become new queens. Each queen ant can lay thousands of eggs per year.
Desert Insects. Insects, a major group of arthropods, have six-legs, an exoskeleton (hard part is on the outside) and three main body sections (head, thorax, and abdomen). Most insects have wings although not all of them fly.
Desert Wildlife. Insects, a major group of arthropods, have six-legs, an exoskeleton (hard part is on the outside) and three main body sections (head, thorax, and abdomen). Most insects have wings although not all of them fly.
Solenopsis xyloni. Three species of fire ants inhabit the desert southwest: the Solenopsis xyloni, the Solenopsis aurea and the Solenopsis amblychila. The common name refers to the antsâ notoriously nasty sting. Solenopsis comes from the Greek solen (channel or pipe) and opsis (appearance, face).
Ants are found just about every habitat on land except the very coldest. All ant species need sheltered places to nest and take care of their offspring. Most species nest underground, but some nest in trees. Some very small ant species can make nests inside acorns and other small hiding places.
Sahara desert ant. Sahara desert ant, any of several species of ant in the genus Cataglyphis that dwell in the Sahara, particularly C. fortis and C. bicolor. The navigational capabilities of these ants have been the subject of numerous scientific investigations.
Just as individual ants go through stages of development, so do ant colonies. An adult ant colony raises reproductive (sexual) male and female forms, which can be recognized (in the desert) by the presence of wings.
The desert fire ant is a natural part of the Sonoran Desert community; unfortunately, it does resemble its eastern relative in its aggressive behavior and annoying sting. Most fire ants are J inch (3mm) long with some as large as N inch (8 mm); they are shiny brick red to black.
Some ants prefer meat; these are the desert army ants (genus Neivamyrmex). These ants raid the nests of other desert ants and occasionally take other prey as well. Because they are predatory and deplete the prey in any one area, they are nomadic and move from place to place.

David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine once said, You cannot talk about rock in the 1970s without talking about Grand Funk Railroad!. Known for their crowd-pleasing arena rock style, the band was well-regarded by audiences despite a relative lack of critical acclaim.
The album We're an American Band topped out at No. 2 on the charts. We're an American Band was Grand Funk's first No. 1 hit, followed by Brewer's #19 hit Walk Like a Man. 1974's The Loco-Motion was Grand Funk's second chart-topping single, followed by Brewer's #11 hit Shinin' On.
Grand Funk Railroad, sometimes shortened as Grand Funk, is an American rock band that was highly popular during the 1970s, touring extensively and playing to packed arenas worldwide. Known for their crowd-pleasing arena rock style, the band was well-regarded by audiences despite a relative lack of critical acclaim.
By late 1971 the band was concerned with Knight's managerial style and fiscal responsibility. This growing dissatisfaction led Grand Funk Railroad to fire Knight in early 1972. Knight sued for breach of contract, which resulted in a protracted legal battle.
Brewer, Schacher and Frost remained intact and formed the band Flint. Flint released one album on Columbia Records; a second record was finished but never released. Grand Funk Railroad reunited in 1981 without Frost and with Dennis Bellinger replacing Schacher on bass.

Diabetic neuropathy can also cause this problem of experiencing sweet sensation in the mouth. Treatment : You need to consult your doctor if you start sensing constant sweet taste in your mouth. He would find out the underlying cause for this problem which is only a symptom of some other disease.
âSweet taste in the mouth can be caused by various medical problems,â says Jordan S. Josephson, MD, Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in NY, Author of Sinus Relief Now, Director of the New York Nasal and Sinus Center.
Will look at the links, thanks! The taste issue seems to be linked to my salt intake though - I happen to be using a lot more salt in my cooking (roast pork belly and salt baked fish. Yum!) and the sweet taste seems to be less obvious this couple of days. Energy levels are still messed up though.
Try adding a little honey, artificial sweetener or sugar to decrease the salty, bitter or acid taste of foods. Add sweet fruits to meals. Drink ginger ale or mint tea to cover up bitter tastes and help in swallowing food.
Loss of taste can cause you to add too much sugar or salt to make food taste better. This can be a problem for people with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. In severe cases, loss of taste can lead to depression. If you are experiencing a taste disorder, talk with your doctor.
Taste changes can be caused by different cancer treatments and their side effects. Dry mouth, damage to the nerves involved in tasting, mouth infections, nausea and vomiting, and dental or gum disease can also have an effect on the way food tastes.
Sweet Taste in Mouth: Causes and Solutions A sweet taste in the mouth that wonât go away can have one of several serious causes. This ongoing sensation can leave a person quite unsettled when thereâs been no drink or sugary candy to explain it.
A constant sweetness in your mouth is as good a reason to see your doctor as any. To aid the diagnosis, you may be asked to undergo a complete physical exam. In this way, doctors can eliminate possible reasons for the sweetness. Should this taste in oneâs mouth be intermittent, itâs most likely harmless.
When there is disruption in the nerve signal due to nervous disorder like stroke or seizure, you may have this problem of getting sweet taste in mouth. Diabetic neuropathy can also cause this problem of experiencing sweet sensation in the mouth. Treatment: You need to consult your doctor if you start sensing constant sweet taste in your mouth. He would find out the underlying cause for this problem which is only a symptom of some other disease.
Make time to go to the doctor. make them test everything, and get a scan of your brain. don't just settle for your local GP - get a reference from them if necessary for you to go to a neurologist until you are completely sure that you have the facts about what the cause of this is.
Energy, as an enigmatic concept, is sometimes defined as the ability to do work.
Answers (1) Jewels Vern. Energy is sometimes defined as capacity to do work. But work is defined as disordering energy. So energy is capacity to do disordering energy. That is a circular definition. Energy is not a physical unit. It is a philosophical concept and an accounting technique used to analyze mechanical and chemical exchanges. In nuclear physics it is defined as a wavelength of light, in biology it is a synonym for metabolism, and in public utilities they say energy when they mean connectivity. Anybody who uses the word in any other context does not know what he is talking about.

They define it as the product of how far the object goes multiplied by how much force that takes. (W=DF) It the force isn't lined up with the direction of travel, you have to â¦use the formula W=DFcos(Î¸), where Î¸ is how many degrees off the force is from the direction of travel.
What term is defined as the capacity to do work? Energy is defined as the capacity to do work. The word able applies to a capable of doing work, or doing it correctly.
The ability to do work is called what? Posted: 3+ months ago by jod_softb... Topics: work
Best Answer: That would be the scientific definition of 'energy'. Energy is adherent to the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy is neither created nor destroyed in any action. To illustrate this, just think of a sandwich.
Mechanical energy and work are the same thing. Work is the force  times the distance moved in the direction of the force. So lifting  a 1 kg mass by 1 metre represents an amâ¦ount of work equal to the  weight times the distance: 9.806 Newtons times 1 metre equals 9.806  Joules.
The term heat conductivity is best defined by the ability of heat to do what? Answer . Take Thermometer and put it in the hot water -Calculate Temparature-go with the formula of Conductivity of heat
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS: 1  Complete the NIMS Awareness Course IS-700 National Incident Management System (NIMS), An Introduction.. (All entry level First Responders and disaster workers); 2  Complete ICS 100: Introduction to ICS. (All entry level First Responders and disaster workers); 3  Complete ICS 200: Basic ICS.

FY 2006 NIMS Training Requirements. Overview. National Incident Management System-related training is one of the important elements that state, territorial, tribal and local entities must complete during Fiscal Year 2006 (Oct. 1, 2005 â Sept. 30, 2006) to become fully compliant with the NIMS.
The NIMS program consists of the NIMS-700 and NIMS- 800 courses. For those agencies (Federal, State, County, Tribal, Local Fire Departments, etc.) that receive federal funding (i.e. grants, wildland reimbursement, etc.) NIMS 700 is required. All chief officers for those agencies need to complete NIMS 800.
NIMS is a dynamic system. and the doctrine and implementation requirements will continue to evolve as our prevention, preparedness, response and recovery capabilities improve and our homeland security landscape changes. New personnel will need NIMS training and NIMS processes will have to be exercised in future years. The successful implementation of NIMS depends on the participation and integration of all state, territorial, local and community-based organizations, including public, non-governmental and.
A: The National Incident Management System (NIMS) Training Program defines the national NIMS training program as it relates to the NIMS components of Preparedness, Communications and Information Management, Resource Management and Command and Management.
Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive #5 (February 2003), the Federal government has created the National Incident Management System (NIMS). This system directs the creation of a comprehensive, national approach to incident management by federal, state, territorial, Tribal and local responders. The Presidential Directive also makes NIMS compliance a requirement for any of these entities wishing to receive Federal funds starting with Federal fiscal year 2007.
NIMS Compliance: What training do I need? âNIMS Complianceâ is required only for those agencies/jurisdictions that wish to apply for any Federal preparedness. grants (Homeland Security, Assistance to Firefighters Act, etc.) However, since ICS is used across the country by. response agencies for just about all incidents, it is good training to have. The Federal guidance for NIMS/ICS training has several recommendations, and they can often be confusing.
One of the most questioned aspects of wildland fire training is the certification requirements for Incident Command System (ICS) and National Incident Management System (NIMS) certification. The basis for NIMS/ICS requirements is outlined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) at this website. The National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) clarified the wildland training requirements of NIMS/ICS last month, and has an easy-to-use chart.

Bill Clinton has been paid $104.9 million for 542 speeches around the world between January 2001, when he left the White House, and January 2013, when Hillary stepped down as secretary of state, according to a Washington Post review of the familyâs federal financial disclosures.
Besides flipping and being a real estate agent there are more ways to use real estate to make a lot of money. Development: Probably the way to make the most money the fastest in real estate is by developing land into residential or commercial projects.
Goldman Sachs has hired Bill Clinton for eight speeches over the years totaling $1.35 million, many of them client meetings in such locales as Paris, Phoenix, and the South Carolina beach resort of Kiawah Island.
Although slightly more than half of his appearances were in the United States, the majority of his speaking income, $56.3 million, came from foreign speeches, many of them in China, Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom, the Post review found. The financial industry has been Clintonâs most frequent sponsor.
There are, first of all, the estates of the realm, but there are also the trades, the state of matrimony and that of virginity, the state of sin. At court there are the 'four estates of the body and mouth': bread-masters, cup-bearers, carvers, and cooks. In the Church there are sacerdotal orders and monastic orders.
However, when you invest in real estate or even buy a house to live in, the wealth you are gaining is not as simple as the increase in value of the home. Leverage: Most people get a loan when they buy a house. Getting a loan increases your returns if housing prices increase.
You donât have to use real estate to become rich, but I feel it is one of the easier ways to make a lot of money. This article goes into detail on how my rental properties increased my net worth by $600,000 in 3.5 years.
There was no single system of dividing society into estates, and systems developed over time. The best known system is the French three-estate system that was used until the French Revolution: the clergy (first estate), the nobility (second estate), and commoners (third estate). Some countries considered burghers and rural commoners separate estates, notably Scandinavian nations and Russia.
In 2011, the Silicon Valley Information Business Alliance paid Bill Clinton $200,000 to address about 400 entrepreneurs on trade issues with China and the financial crisis in Europe. Clinton spoke for about an hour, took questions and posed for pictures, said James Cai, a lawyer and president of the alliance.
The First Estate. A depiction of the three Estates in order, the clergy on the left. Before the revolution, French society was divided into three estates or orders. The First Estate contained around 130,000 ordained members of the Catholic church: from archbishops and bishops down to parish priests, monks, friars and nuns. The First Estate occupied a prestigious place in the social order.
Sex and gender as a political idea Materialist feminists question the very existence of gender categories, arguing that âwomenâ and âmenâ are social categories defined in relation to each other rather than on the basis of a pre-social biological essence.
Judith Lorber argues that sex and gender are not pure categories; while they are different physiologically they are âtransformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are âfemaleâ and âmaleââ.
You are living in the period prior to 1800 when religion had not yet been replaced by science as the main âexplainerâ of our world. Feminist Gender Theory Summary â Margaret Simmonds â Summer 2012. Page 2 of 10. At that time there wasnât even the concept of âsexâ as we know it.
Gender as omnirelevant means that we can always be judged by what we do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.
Gender socialization occurs through such diverse means as parental attitudes, schools, how peers interact with each other, and mass media. Sometimes gender roles lead to inequality; for example, women's social roles were once more restricted regarding politics, and United States law prohibited women from voting.
There ar e parallels here with the pre-1800 situation, in which, Laqueur suggests, âgender precedes sexâ. And Delphy claims that recognizing a difference is a social act, as opposed to the differences being a self-e vident fact, and she calls into question the very existence of the categories.
Society typically only recognizes two genders. Therefore, when transsexuals want to have a sex change operation, they must prove that they can pass as a man or woman-so even the choice of changing oneâs gender is socially constructed.
These fe minists align themselves with an approach originating in the ideas of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, an associate of de Beauvoir and proponent. Feminist Gender Theory Summary â Margaret Simmonds â Summer 2012.
Definition of Gender Socialization. Gender socialization is the process of learning the social expectations and attitudes associated with one's sex. Sociologists explain through gender socialization why human males and females behave in different ways: they learn different social roles. For example, girls learn to do different household chores than boys; girls learn to bake and clean, and boys learn to mow lawns and take out garbage.
Allied to this is an internalised social surveillance or disciplining, that individuals apply to themselves (Foucault 1976-1984).Talking about gender as a performance can suggest an actor on a stage, an agent or subject who is formed prior to the acts and who engages in them, maybe choosing which acts to perform.
Before the Declaration of Independence. Even after the initial battles in the Revolutionary War broke out, few colonists desired complete independence from Great Britain, and those who didâlike John Adamsâ were considered radical.
The Committee of Five. Congress picked a committee to write a declaration explaining why the colonies wanted independence. They chose John Adams of Massachusetts, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Robert Livingston of New York and Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. Jefferson was not a great speaker.
1 Basically, the Declaration of Independence declared war against King George and Great Britain. 2  The Declaration of Independence was signed by the Congressional Representatives of the Thirteen Colonies on July 4, 1776. 3  Many believe that the most famous and important words in the English language are:
by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the. Pursuit of Happiness.â. 1  After the letter was finalized on July 4, the Second Continental Congress made copies and distributed it to the people. 2  Underneath the word âcitizensâ there is a smudge on the Declaration of Independence. 3  The original Declaration of Independence was not well cared for. 4  The Declaration of Independence was written on 5  ... Fifty
John Adams said of Jefferson, During the whole time I sat with him in Congress, I never heard him utter three sentences together.. But he was known for his writing skills. The committee of five men picked Jefferson to write the declaration proclaiming the independence of the colonies.
The Declaration of Independence is a famous document for many reasons. It declared the colonies independence from Great Britain. It stated basic rights and liberties for Americans. As time went by, the ideas Jeffersonâs words âall men are created equalâ grew in importance.
Together with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence can be counted as one of the three essential founding documents of the United States government. 1  Tags. 2  American Revolution.
Jefferson Drafts the Declaration of the Indpendence. Jefferson had earned a reputation as an eloquent voice for the patriotic cause after his 1774 publication of âA Summary View of the Rights of British America,â and he was given the task of producing a draft of what would become the Declaration of Independence.
The Declaration of Independence is the usual name of a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with Great Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen newly independent sovereign states, and no longer a part of the British Empire.

(in agile software development). Velocity is a term used in agile software development to illustrate the rate of progress for a team or a set of teams (i.e. a project/program).
Part of the Agile, Scrum, XP glossary: Velocity is a metric that predicts how much work an Agile software development team can successfully complete within a two-week sprint (or similar time-boxed period).
My thinking on velocity and Agile Estimation has evolved. 1  Simple estimation techniques work! 2  Story Points considered harmful, or why the future of estimation is really in our past. 3  A better way to predict project release date. 4  Focus on what matters, a #NoEstimates advocacy post. 5  The #NoEstimates how to.
Velocity. By far the single most important word to any Agile team. Whether you are currently practicing Agile, looking to adopt within your organization or trying to achieve your Agile Nirvana, understanding Velocity is fundamental to achieving success with Agile. Beyond a basic understanding, itâs important that you learn how to measure, influence and improve upon it.
At a project/progam level, velocity is the rate at which the whole project is burning the User Stories (or requirements) from the backlog. Also, without knowing your team/project's velocity you can not make longer term planning (over 1 sprint) or even release planning.
If the product backlog has 300 story points, and the team is averaging 30 story points per sprint, it can be estimated that team members will require 10 more sprints to complete work. If each sprint lasts two weeks, then the project will last 20 more weeks.
If this is your teamâs first iteration you can still plan your initial Velocity. A good rule of thumb when using time-based estimates (e.g., days, ideal days, etc) is to plan initial Velocity at one-half your teamâs total available time.
Calculating your Agile teams Velocity is quite simple. Just sum the total estimates (story points, days, ideal days or hours) of user stories, requirements or backlog items that were delivered and accepted within a prior Sprint (iteration).
The metric is calculated by reviewing work the team successfully completed during previous sprints; for example, if the team completed 10 stories during a two-week sprint and each story was worth 3 story points, then the team's velocity is 30 story points per sprint.
Note that velocity is a range, not an exact number. For example, if you have developed 2, 5 and 4 stories respectively in your past 3 sprints, then you know that your velocity is 2-5, not 3 or 4.
To start a sprinkler system after winterizing you must first know where the sprinkler system shut offs are. If you had an irrigation service company shut down, blow out, and drain the system sometimes it is easier just to call them back to turn it on.
Irrigation systems are also used for dust suppression, disposal of sewage, and in mining. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given area.
6000 BC. 1  Irrigation began at about the same time in Egypt and Mesopotamia (present day Iraq and Iran) using the water of the flooding Nile or Tigris/Euphrates rivers. The flood waters, which occurred July through December, were diverted to fields for 40 to 60 days.
In the early years, all of a townâs water might come from the irrigation ditch. In St. George, the city had a rule that first thing in the morning, families could fill their barrels with ditch water for the day. Mormon pioneers in Cache Valley, Utah, built the Logan/Hyde Park/Smithfield Canal in 1861-62.
Even using dams and irrigation ditches, there wasnât (and isn't!) enough water for everyone to use all they wanted. Usually, the first people to start using water from the stream had priority water rights. Communities had to establish rules about using water. At first, LDS bishops were in charge of water use.
The following steps will guide you through the process to start a sprinkler system after winterizing. 1  To turn a sprinkler system on located the sprinkler shut off valves. In my area there are stop and waste valves in the ground and then pressure vacuum breakers above ground. 2  Turn on the valves.
In the early years, all of a townâs water might come from the irrigation ditch. In St. George, the city had a rule that first thing in the morning, families could fill their barrels with ditch water for the day. (In the summer, they had to wrap the barrels with wet blankets to keep the water cool.)
Irrigation canal in Osmaniye, Turkey. Irrigation is the method in which a controlled amount of water is supplied to plants at regular intervals for agriculture. It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall.
The annual flood season along the Nile was unpredictable without records, so the Egyptians created a flood gauge called the Nilometer. The simplest design was a vertical column submerged in the river with marked intervals indicating the depth of the river. A second design was a flight of stairs leading into the river.
Both of which are usually off and can shut off the sprinkler system. Turn on the valves. The stop and waste valve in the ground requires a long meter key to reach it. Most stop and waste valves turn 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise direction to turn them on.
The World's 15 Most Amazing Stadiums. The World Cup: the planet's finest gladiators (footballers) gathering to do battle (play football) inside purpose-built theatres of duel (stadiums).And the stadiums are often truly jaw-dropping.he stadium was built as the main venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics and has also hosted the 1974 World Cup Final and the Euro '88 Final. It hosted the European Cup Finals of 1979, 1993 and 1997. The stadium was built by Bilfinger Berger between 1968 to 1972 in a pit made by bombs dropped on Munich during World War II.
Of course, this would not be possible without said great players and their respective teams and fans, but without a stadium to host and encapsulate all that sticks in our minds, the mere memories would be lost. Gone forever. So, with that in mind, we'll rank the top 20 stadiums in world football.To help me decide on where they should go, I will determine size of the stadium, atmosphere and visual appeal to rank them in order.he Maracana is one of the most notable stadiums in world football, situated in one of the most beautiful cities throughout the world.
Capacity: 80,000. Home to the Dallas Cowboys, the stadium is the fourth biggest in the NFL and is s the largest column-free room in the world. We love the way it's still, technically, a room.The retractable glass end-zone doors, at 180 feet wide and 120 feet high, are the largest operable glass doors in the world.he stadium was built as the main venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics and has also hosted the 1974 World Cup Final and the Euro '88 Final. It hosted the European Cup Finals of 1979, 1993 and 1997. The stadium was built by Bilfinger Berger between 1968 to 1972 in a pit made by bombs dropped on Munich during World War II.
Sure, we can grant Santiago Bernabeu elite status among world stadiums, but Camp Nou edges it by a hair. Overall, the complex is more impressively grandiose and the fans rowdier. And it's home to the world's best soccer team. No other soccer stadium in Europe can compete with the capacity crowds of Camp Nou.At 100,000 strong, the homeside can rely on an incessant atmosphere that intimidates like no other, a quality current players Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi appreciate.he stadium also hosted the Game of the Century, when Italy defeated West Germany 4-3 in extra time in one of the 1970 semifinals. So Estadio Azteca brings out the best and the worst in the world's best football players. The buzz here, especially when Mexico are playing, is electric.
With the world having much love for football, the need for better and bigger stadiums has always resulted in some iconic infrastructures, several of which have become worldâs best stadiums.If you are unaware of where these beautiful stadiums are located, below is the top ten list of football stadiums in the world.ith the world having much love for football, the need for better and bigger stadiums has always resulted in some iconic infrastructures, several of which have become worldâs best stadiums.
1 Only stadiums with a capacity of 40,000 or more are included in this list. 2  Stadiums that are defunct or closed, or those that no longer serve as competitive sports venues (such as Strahov Stadium, which was the largest in the world and holds around 220,000 spectators), are not included. A stadium's record attendance is not considered relevant to its regular or official capacity; for records achieved during sports events in (among other venues) stadiums, see List of sporting venues with a highest attendance of 100,000 or more.
As the only stadium to have ever had the privilege of being asked to host two World Cup finals (1970 and 1986), the Azteca stadium is the most iconic in world football, as well as being both the fifth-largest ground in the world and the largest football pitch on Planet Football.ome to Liverpool FC, Anfield is renowned throughout the game for the incredible atmosphere that the ground generates, particularly on big European nights, with the Spion Kop behind one of the goals perhaps the most famous stand in world football.

Some of the bright orange and yellow pictures that you see of Venus are actually false color images. They were taken in a different wavelength of light, such as ultraviolet, and then artificially colored on computer to reveal features.But seen with your own eyes, the color of Venus is just bright white and featureless.ost pictures you have seen of Venus are in false color. This means that some spacecraft took photos of Venus using a different wavelength of light to show features in its atmosphere.
Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of â4.6, bright enough to cast shadows.ith a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 Â°C; 863 Â°F), Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light.
Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's sister planet because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects.It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide.ith a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 Â°C; 863 Â°F), Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.

In a lever when the load is between fulcrum and effort, it is classified as a Type 2 Lever. A nutcracker is one example. Observing a nutcracker in action, it is clear that only point that does not move, i.e. the fulcrum, is at the end of the instrument where the two blades meet..
Class 3 Levers In class 2 levers, the fulcrum lies at one end, the effort is applied at the other end, and the load is placed at the middle. The closer the load is to the fulcrum, the lesser amount of force needed to lift it.
Class 3: Effort in the middle: the resistance (or load) is on one side of the effort and the fulcrum is located on the other side, for example, a pair of tweezers or the human mandible. The effort arm is smaller than the load arm. Mechanical advantage is always less than 1. It is also called speed multiplier lever.
(Redirected from First-class lever) A lever (/ËliËvÉr/ or US: /ËlÉvÉr/) is a machine consisting of a beam or rigid rod pivoted at a fixed hinge, or fulcrum. A lever is a rigid body capable of rotating on a point on itself. On the basis of the location of fulcrum, load and effort, the lever is divided into three types.

This allows the identification of three classes of levers by the relative locations of the fulcrum, the resistance and the effort: 1  Class 1: Fulcrum in the middle: the effort is applied on one side of the fulcrum and the resistance (or load) on the other side, for example, a seesaw, a crowbar or a pair of scissors.
Here are some everyday examples of class 2 levers: The wheelbarrow is the classic example of a class 2 lever. (Image from Microsoft Clip Organizer) A nutcracker is a combination of two class 2 levers. (Image from Microsoft Clip Organizer)
Class 2: Resistance (or load) in the middle: the effort is applied on one side of the resistance and the fulcrum is located on the other side, for example, a wheelbarrow, a nutcracker, a bottle opener or the brake pedal of a car. Load arm is smaller than the effort arm. Mechanical advantage is always greater than 1.

The entire floor distributes a consistent, even and quiet heating.
Pex Plumbing System with a Boiler Hello, My family just bought and moved into a new home. My parents had a hydronic heating system in their house. The heat was always comfortable there so I was excited to see it when we looked at this house. I need to do some plumbing work on the water supply. I have read about using oxygen impermeable PEX on the lines between the boiler and the radiator.
PEX-A is the most flexible of all PEX tubing types, has little or no coil memory and gives installer an ability to repair kinks with a heat gun. It has been in use for over 50 years (which is longer than other types) with few publicly known issues , which is a good indicator of reliability.
PEX Tubing Comparisons PEX-A PEX-B PEX-C Compared! HousePEX PEX-A & PEX-C Tubing Techs / Specs / Benefits. HousePEX PEX-A tubing is crosslinked using peroxide crosslinking, a so called PEX-a process. By means of heat, a peroxide mixed into the PE raw material is split into radicals. These radicals react with the PE polymer chain and absorb hydrogen atoms to become inert. The polymer chains now becomes radicals.
Hereâs 6 ways to get motivated when you feel like doing nothing. Here are some of the reasons you may be in a slump: 1  Youâre dreading something you know you need to do. Youâre procrastinating getting things done because you are totally loathing an upcoming task.  Youâre tired.

Part 1 Feeling Full Basics. 1. Drink water. In order to get your stomach going on the Oh, I'm eating! hormone, preface your meals with a glass or two of water. Then, when the food comes in, your stomach will tell you you're fuller sooner. For the record, water has absolutely zero calories.
Opt for fiber. Fiber, too, is great at making you feel full before you go back for seconds. It only has 1.5-2.5 calories per gram (compared to carbs and fat, at 4 and 9 respectively) and, to top it off, most fiber-rich foods require chewing and slow the food in your digestive tract.
The good news is that we can often discover why weâre in a slump. Even better, there are ways to get out of the slump and get motivated again. Hereâs 6 ways to get motivated when you feel like doing nothing. 1. Figure out why youâre in a slump. Youâre dreading something you know you need to do.

The patient simply places his or her heel in the sonometer, and it is then scanned using ultrasound to determine bone density. This is a fast and low-cost procedure generally lasting 30 seconds or less. Results typically are available immediately following the procedure.
A sonometer, or audiometer, is used to determine hearing sensitivity, while a clinical bone sonometer measures bone density to help determine such conditions as the risk of osteoporosis. In audiology, the device is used to test for hearing loss and other disorders of the ear.
A sonometer is an apparatus made of a hollow box having two holes.
A string is attached to it by which the transverse vibrations of strings can be studied. It is also called the monochord because it often has only one string. On the wooden rectangular box are two fixed bridges, near the ends, and at one end is a pulley. A string ,wire is fastened at one end, run over the bridges and the pulley, and attached to a weight holder hanging below the pulley.

1 Impact of red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on harvest of soybean in North Carolina. 2  Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Society 93: 150-152. 3  Banks WA, Adams CT, Lofgren CS, Wojcik DP. 1990.
Originally, S. invicta was believed to be a red form of the black species S. saevissima richteri Forel. In 1972, Buren described the black imported fire ant to be a separate and distinct species, S. richteri Forel, and the RIFA was identified as S. invicta Buren (Hedges 1997).
Red imported fire ants. The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), or simply RIFA, is one of over 280 species in the widespread genus Solenopsis. It is native to South America but it has become both a pest and a health hazard in the southern United States as well as a number of other countries.
Multiple queen colonies have been found in areas of Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Georgia, being more frequent in the western edge of their range (Vinson and Sorenson 1986). Figure 14. Polygyne colony of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture also lists the entire island of Puerto Rico as infested. Range of the RIFA in the United States. RIFAs were still on the move in the US in the early 21st century, often traveling from one area to another in turf, root balls of nursery plants, and other agricultural products.
As of 2011 in the United States they were found in most of the southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.
RIFA is native to central South America. It is also established in the U.S. and Australia (Queensland, near Brisbane-as of 2001) (Shattuck and Barnett 2005). Figure 2. Lateral view of a media worker of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren.
Two species of fire ants are found in Florida. Most notorious is Solenopsis invicta Buren, the red imported fire ant (RIFA), followed by the much less common Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius), the tropical or native fire ant.
They build mounds, usually no larger than 46 cm (18 in) in diameter and 46 cm (18 in) in height, although in Alabama some mounds have been reported to be over 60 cm high (2 ft) and larger, especially in fields where cattle graze.
The ants then spread from Alabama to almost every state of the American South, from Texas to Maryland and a few other Mid-Atlantic states. Since the 1990s infestations have been reported in New Mexico and parts of Arizona in the Southwest.

Labeling theory is the theory of how the self-identity and behavior of individuals may be determined or influenced by the terms used to describe or classify them. It is associated with the concepts of self-fulfilling prophecy and stereotyping.
According to the theory, labeling and not helping is most responsible for the criminal behavior and social problems that continue to occur. Once an individual is labeled there is no getting around that through both the government and society.
Labeling theory is the theory of how the self-identity and behavior of individuals may be determined or influenced by the terms used to describe or classify them.
However, labeling theory proposes deviance is socially constructed through reaction instead of action. In other words, according to this theory, no behavior is inherently deviant on its own. Instead, it's the reaction to the behavior that makes it deviant or not.
Labeling theory is closely related to social-construction and symbolic-interaction analysis. Labeling theory was developed by sociologists during the 1960s. Howard Saul Becker's book Outsiders was extremely influential in the development of this theory and its rise to popularity.
Beginning in the 1950s with the work of people like Becker and Lemert (and continuing down to the present day in the pages of the journal, Social Problems) , the symbolic interactionist approach to deviance began to focus on the way in which negative labels get applied and on the consequences of the labeling process.
Labeling others is common in our society. In this lesson, we discuss the specifics of labeling theory, including when and why people are labeled. We also distinguish between retroactive and projective labeling and briefly discuss Travis Hirschi's control theory.
1 Deviance is socially created and determined by the majority. 2  There are inconsistencies among societies as to what is deviance, and inconsistencies in the labeling of behavior as deviant within a single society.

For every 40 pound dog add 1 teaspoon of white distilled vinegar or apple cider vinegar to 1 quart of their drinking water. We highly recommend using Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar. Not only does it deter fleas, it improves a pups skin and coat condition from the inside-out.
Coconut oil is part of their diet, and I know for sure, there will be less hair balls hacking up from both cats and Dante will have more energy and healthy teeth and gums and the fur coats have already become shiny and less shedding.
Skin and Coat. Coconut oil can be very beneficial for pets when taken internally. Adding the oil to their food is the simplest way to include it in their diet. Just a few drops a day can be very beneficial to the coat, moisturizing the skin and hair. Coconut oil can be used in its semi-solid form or warmed slightly to make it liquid. For dogs and cats, add 1/4 teaspoon of oil for every 10 pounds they weigh. Slowly increase to 1 teaspoon for every 10 pounds of weight per day, or 1 Tablespoon for every 30 pounds.

Be careful with borax on carpet or yard, if dogs get in lungs, it can cause respiratory problems. I do use 1/2 cup borax in bath water for them once a week during flea seasonâ¦then rinse though. Lavender spray is effective repellent. To make, use 1 cup of water and about 20 drops of quality essential lavender oil.
Neurosurgery is any type of surgery used to treat nervous system problems (problems with the brain, spinal cord and nerves). In cases of severe head injury, neurosurgery is usually carried out on the brain. These problems will be identified during tests and a CT scan.
The severity of symptoms depends on whether the injury is mild, moderate or severe. 1  Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as a concussion, either doesn't knock you out or knocks you out for 30 minutes or less.  Moderate traumatic brain injury causes unconsciousness lasting more than 30 minutes.
Some research suggests that traumatic brain injury may be more likely to cause dementia in individuals who have a variation of the gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE) called APOE-e4. More research is needed to understand the link between APOE-e4 and dementia risk in those who've had a brain injury.
A craniotomy is one of the main types of surgery used to treat severe head injuries. During a craniotomy, a hole is made in the skull so that the surgeon can access your brain. The procedure will be carried out under general anaesthetic, so you'll be unconscious and unable to feel any pain or discomfort.
The severity of symptoms depends on whether the injury is mild, moderate or severe. Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as a concussion, either doesn't knock you out or knocks you out for 30 minutes or less. Symptoms often appear at the time of the injury or soon after, but sometimes may not develop for days or weeks.
Treating a severe head injury. A severe head injury must always be treated in hospital to minimise the risk of complications. The healthcare professionals treating you will prioritise any potentially life-threatening injuries. For example, they may: check your airway is clear.
In cases of severe head injury, neurosurgery is usually carried out on the brain. Possible reasons for neurosurgery include: a haemorrhage â severe bleeding inside your head, such as a subarachnoid haemorrhage, which puts pressure on the brain and may result in brain injury and, in severe cases, death.
Blows to the head most often cause brain injury, but shaking may also cause damage. The face and jaw are located in the front of the head, and brain injury may also be associated with injuries to these structures. It is also important to note that a head injury does not always mean that there is also a brain injury. The brain is a soft and pliable material, almost jelly-like in feel, and is surrounded by a thin layer of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Falls are the most common cause of traumatic brain injury, and falling poses an especially serious risk for older adults. When a senior sustains a traumatic brain injury in a fall, direct effects of the injury may result in long-term cognitive changes, reduced ability to function and changes in emotional health.
Picture of the brain and potential brain injury areas. Head injuries due to bleeding are often classified by the location of the blood within the skull. Epidural hematoma: With an epidural hematoma, the bleeding is located between the dura mater and the skull (epi=outside). This injury often occurs along the side of the head where the middle meningeal artery runs in a groove along the temporal bone.
Causes of Watermelon Splits. There are a few causes of watermelon splits. The most common cause for a bursting watermelon is erratic watering. Whether itâs due to poor irrigation practices or drought followed by heavy rain, excessive accumulation of water can put the fruit under a lot of pressure.
So did I call it? Pretty cool, right? The answer-to-a-question-you-probably-never-asked video (but was amazing to watch all the same) was done by The Slow Mo Guys, who have been featured here on The Feed a few times in the past for their fun perspectives on all things super slow-motion.
The second stress comes from the mixing of air into the whites, which causes the proteins to come out of their natural state. These denatured proteins gather together where the air and water meet and create multiple bonds with the other unraveled proteins, and thus become a foam, holding the incorporated air in place.
Like most fruits, water makes up a large percentage of the fruit. When the soil becomes dry, the fruit forms a tight skin in order to prevent moisture loss. However, once a sudden surge in water returns, the skin expands. As a result, the watermelon bursts. Another possibility, in addition to water, is heat.
Answers.comÂ® is making the world better one answer at a time. It means it's gone bad. I don't know what caused it, but I had the same thing happen. The foam had a slight smell to it, but when I cut into it it sounded like I was opening a brand new bottle of soda.
Crohnâs disease is usually diagnosed when other potential causes of your symptoms have been ruled out. Itâs important to fully understand the circumstances surrounding an upset stomach before assuming you have a medical condition.
Watch a watermelon wrapped in rubber bands explode in slow-motion. (CBS News) Have you ever wondered if you could cause a watermelon to explode by wrapping a ton of rubber bands around it? And have you additionally wondered what that explosion would end up looking like in super slow-motion? The answer to both questions is probably not, but it's very cool to watch happen anyways.
In some cases, an upset stomach is the result of an allergic reaction to a certain type of food. It also may be caused by an irritation. Sometimes this happens from consuming too much alcohol or caffeine. Eating too many fatty foods â or too much food in general â may also cause an upset stomach. Advertisement.
It appears that the force and pressure that a band of a large number of rubber bands wrapped around the middle of the watermelon can cause a crack in the rind of the watermelon under the rubber bands. The crack then propagates and ends up splitting the watermelon in 2 or more pieces.
With 400 rubber bands and a large watermelon you can demonstrate the difference between potential and kinetic energy by exploding a watermelon with rubber bands. You probably want some goggles to protect your eyes. Place a bunch of rubber bands around the middle of the watermelon. Be careful though as all that pressure from the outsite will start to explode the watermelon. Rubber bands are a great example of potential energy. Potential energy is energy that is stored up, not being used, just waiting to be unleashed.
The two main characters, Adam and Harley (Eric Jungmann and Justin Urich), are two guys on opposite ends of the extreme. Harley is an obnoxious, loud mouthed punk and Adam is a meek and timid guy who needs to stand up for himself.
Other Notable Monster Truck Show Injuries and Death. Although Monster Jam is by far the most famous, there are other monster truck shows. Here is a look at some other fan injuries and deaths that happened at events other than Monster Jams. This list examines deaths since 1992.
A Texas man used his monster truck to rescue neighbors in Millsap, Texas, during major flooding that struck the region this past week. Deborah Wright, a local resident, was trapped in her home on Monday morning when her longtime neighbor and friend Cole Geeo drove through the flooded roads to her rescue.
Death at a Monster Jam Show. Monster Jam is one of the most popular of the monster truck series and has shows that travel all over the country. Even though the machines are big and loud and the stunts they do can amaze, there have been very few problems with fan injuries or deaths at Monster Jam shows.
The top of Geeo's self-built 1978 Ford F-150 pickup truck is ten feet off the ground and the tires are 63 inches tall, so he was able to drive down the flooded roads, he told ABC News. Because the monster truck is so tall, Wright said she had to use a ladder to get inside.
In late 2009, it was anounced that Marvel will re-join FELD Motorsports and Spider-Man would return, along with the new Iron Man truck. The driver is Whit Tarlton, who, like Brandon Harrington, tours with Gary Porter.
While driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved Betty-Ann, Adam is surprised by his former schoolmate Harley on the backseat of his car. Adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron Harley because of Betty-Ann. Along their road trip, Harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road. After some incidents, they give a lift to the hitchhiker Sarah and sooner the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck.
He competed in the Path of Destruction tour in Baltimore, Philly, and New Jersey. Later in 2012 he competed in Europe and was one of the first drivers to competed in the Team Destruction Vs Team Marvel competion. Spider-Man concept art from the cancelled Marvel Monster Trucks Live show. 2003 Spider-Man toy.
This time it was not a fan but a promoter, George Eisenhart, Jr., who was killed when he stepped out in front of a monster truck near the end fo the show. According to USA Today, the driver of the monster truck, Daniel Patrick, did not see Eisenhart and was unable to prevent the accident.
Spider-Man (along with its teammate Wolverine) debuted in 2001. It was driven by Brandon Harrington and Lee O'Donnell (2001 only) during the normal season and Gary Porter at the Word Finals. It would be driven by Bobby Z at the 2003 World Finals before the Clear Channel (now FELD Motorsports)/Marvel relationship ended.
The most important food in Japan is an old fashioned dish called 'Vowtuzki' .. basically meat balls. I think the most important food in Japan is rice, followed by nori (seaweeâ¦d), then fish, then tofu. I'm no expert.
Beautiful food. Bursting with beauty, taste, and health benefits, the Japanese diet has something to offer anyone who wants to live longer, slimmer, and healthier. Experiment with fish, rice, or vegetables served on your most delicate dishes, and reap the benefits for yourself -- chopsticks not required.
Japan needs imports to keep itself fed. by Kazuaki Nagata. After a spate of food mislabeling frauds and the recent scare over pesticide-laced âgyozaâ dumplings imported from China, consumers are perhaps more conscious than ever of the origin of what they eat.
Fast food chains and processed foods rely heavily on cheaper imported ingredients, he noted. According to a survey by the Japan Frozen Food Association of 31 member companies, 200,634 tons out of 315,436 tons of precooked frozen imported food in 2006 came from China.
The top three U.S. exports to China in 2008 were electrical machinery ($9.5 billion), oil seeds and related products ($9.3 billion), and nuclear reactors and related machinery ($8.4 billion). China is now one of the most important markets for U.S. exports: in 2009, U.S. exports to China totaled $69.6 billion, a 0.2% decrease from 2008. Those percentages were down far less than U.S. exports to other major trading partners in the year following the global financial crisis.
The belief in the need to promote exports is part of Japan's self-image as a processing nation.. Japan imports raw materials and pays for them by processing the raw materials, thus adding value to them before exporting the output. In recent years, Japan has been the top export market for 15 trading nations worldwide.
Diets of the World: The Japanese Diet. From the WebMD Archives. The Japanese diet is the iPod of food, says Naomi Moriyama, co-author of Japanese Women Don't Get Old or Fat: Secrets of My Mother's Tokyo Kitchen, it concentrates the magnificent energy of food into a compact and pleasurable size..
Japan is the 5th largest importer and exporter in the world. Like many of the other Asian countries that have experienced rapid economic growth in the past few decades, exports have had a historical significance to the Japanese economy. Japan imports raw materials and pays for them by processing the raw materials, thus adding value to them before exporting the output.
Instead of rice, Japanese started eating more meat â for which the nation relied more and more on imports over the years â and consumed more oil, especially vegetable oil, whose ingredients are largely imported. Shogenji also pointed to the increase in imports of livestock feed.
Is rice japans main food? hahaa yea media makes Japanese and Chinese people out to be people who eat rice all the time but their main foods are Rice, fish, miso soup, tofu, natto, pickled vegetables, aâ¦nd fresh vegetables. What is the national food of Japan? Answers.comÂ® is making the world better one answer at a time.

Click on More Info to get the window that will describe the hardware your computer has. Look for words such as CD-R,CD-RW or burner. Keep in mind there are many different types of CD and DVD burners and it can get confusing. But as we mentioned above, CD-R or DVD-R/DVD+R are all we need to use. Click on FAQ on the navigation bar on this site or check your ownerâs manual.
You can back them up to CD or DVD discs, to external hard drives, and even to online services. There are two main approaches to backing up your computer. The first, and possibly the most common, is to make copies of important files. The second is to back up your whole PC hard drive.
Backing up files. It never hurts to take security copies of important files, such as photos and financial data. One cheap and easy way to do this is to âburnâ folders full of these files to blank CD-R or DVD discs. Backups need to be reliable so donât buy the cheapest discs, and donât use rewritable ones (eg CD-RW). Also, always use the âwrite at onceâ option and burn a whole disc, even if itâs not full. When you are saving data, it is not the time to save pennies.
With this type of software, all you need to do is select the folders on your computer that you would like to backup, and it will do it automatically at predetermined times. On the other hand, backup software can be purchased externally.
Tips for Data Backup. 1  There are many ways to backup data on your computer - the least effective of which (for obvious reasons) is having the only backup location on your actual hard drive. Instead, use external hardware such as a disk, CD, zip drive, or memory stick.  Online backup is another option.
If the front of your disc drive says CD-RW, burner or writer then you know it can burn discs. Make sure you're using the right disc. If it only has an R on the end it is 'write once' and can be used for archiving your photos. If it says RW or RAM at the end it is re-writable.
Tips for Data Backup. There are many ways to backup data on your computer - the least effective of which (for obvious reasons) is having the only backup location on your actual hard drive. Instead, use external hardware such as a disk, CD, zip drive, or memory stick.
There are some drawbacks to using these kinds of discs â the main one being that you need a lot of them to back up a big hard drive. A CD-R, for instance, only holds 700 megabytes of data. Another option is a Blu-ray disc which holds up to 25GB on a single layer and 50GB on a double layer disc.
Another variable is the type of data you store on your computer. Obviously, the important it is to you, the more important backing it up becomes. There are many ways to backup data on your computer - the least effective of which (for obvious reasons) is having the only backup location on your actual hard drive.
On Windows: Insert a disc into your PC and click on the Details of the CD drive, then click on the Properties window with a follow up click on Hardware. On a Mac: Go to the Apple menu in the upper left-hand corner of your screen and select About this Mac.

Both full beds and twin beds are 75 inches (191 cm) long. They differ when it comes to width, however. At 54 inches (137 cm) wide, a full size bed is nearly as wide as a queen size bed. Twin beds are much narrower, measuring a mere 39 inches (99 cm) across. Non-Standard Dimensions.

A new mattress may be âdeeperâ, so look for bedding that accommodates premium quality mattresses with deeper pockets. Most standard mattresses are 9-12â deep. A premium mattress could add 4-5â to that measurement. If you add a pillowtop for more comfort, your mattress depth could easily measure 20â.

Views Â· Most Viewed Writer in. Democrats. In the broadest sense, a democrat is one who believes the will of the people is the sole or primary source of legitimacy for a government. Any attempt to distance the will of the people from the resulting government policies is anti-democratic in that sense.
In the broadest sense, a republican is one who opposes the unfettered rule of the people, but also opposes the unfettered rule of the aristocracy (kings, leading families, the rich, etc). A republican wants to balance both sides against each other.
If you can answer that question, you're ahead of the game. For many people, political parties are a puzzle. The dictionary defines them as groups of people who control or seek to control a government.. So much for music and dancing. The U.S. Constitution doesn't even mention political parties. President George Washington warned about the danger of parties..
The Republican Party, commonly referred to as the GOP (abbreviation for Grand Old Party), is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, the other being its historic rival, the Democratic Party.
What it means to be a Republican. As a Republican, I hold to the traditions of our party patriarch, Abraham Lincoln, and our founding documents that all men are created equal and endowed by our creator (be it divine or natural) with certain unalienable rights.
The first official party convention was held on July 6, 1854, in Jackson, Michigan. By 1858, the Republicans dominated nearly all Northern states.The Republican Party first came to power in the elections of 1860 when it won control of both houses of Congress and its candidate, Abraham Lincoln, was elected president.

As a Republican, I hold to the traditions of our party patriarch, Abraham Lincoln, and our founding documents that all men are created equal and endowed by our creator (be it divine or natural) with certain unalienable rights.
The Party strove to contain the expansion of slavery, which would cause the collapse of the slave power and the expansion of freedom. Lincoln, representing the fast-growing western states, won the Republican nomination in 1860 and subsequently won the presidency.
The first public meeting of the general anti-Nebraska movement where the name Republican was suggested for a new anti-slavery party was held on March 20, 1854 in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin. The name was partly chosen to pay homage to Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party.
As you can see, the dictionary definition of a Republican is very brief. And since a Republican is simply defined as âa member of the Republican party of the U.S.â it is important to understand what the Republican Party stands for. To understand what a Republican is you have to understand the Republican Party. And that is what the rest of this article examines. Core Beliefs.

November 26, 2009 at 7:08 pm. What caused Warhammer to fail, plain and simple, is that the game is bad. The game just wasnât very good at launch, and I havenât played in nearly a year now, but it doesnât seem much (or, enough) has changed.
Today Tobold is asking why Warhammer Online failed to live up to itâs mega-title expectations (expectations that I was grossly wrong about as well), give readers either the choice that WotLK killed it (tourists) or that WAR was just a bad game.
Warhammer Online was of the latter variety, with a great deal of hype pushing gamers into frenzied dreams of non-stop virtual carnage set within the Warhammer universe. The game had a successful launch, selling 1.2 million copies and having 800,000 registered users within the first month.
Editor's Note: Warhammer has recently announced that it will be closing their game December 18th, 2013. You can read more about the closing here: http://www.warhammeronline.com/article/Warhammer-Update. Or, continue to read this author's opinion of why Warhammer was a failure, originally written July 31, 2009.

Some mmo games quietly come onto the market while others explode onto the scene, full of promise and potential. Warhammer Online was of the latter variety, with a great deal of hype pushing gamers into frenzied dreams of non-stop virtual carnage set within the Warhammer universe.
Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning (officially abbreviated as WAR) was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on Games Workshop 's Warhammer Fantasy setting.
The thought of taking down several defensive lines and then attacking an enemy city itself was enough to get players grinding to hit the higher level tiers in the game. Sadly, the RvR was a disappointment on several levels and was one of the major components why Warhammer Online failed.
1) Lack of a Third Realm Doomed Warhammer to Failure. If you were only allowed one reason why WAR failed, this would be it. A number of the subsequent failures hinge on the absolute disaster of a decision to go with only two realms. With two realms, the realm you hate most is always the same.

O. J. Simpson murder case. Kaelin gained notoriety for his role as a minor witness for the prosecution in the 1995 O. J. Simpson murder trial. In 1994, Kaelin was staying in a guest house on Simpson's Rockingham estate and was present at the compound on the night of the two murders on June 12.

Newly released from prison for armed robbery, Simpson is living in in a rented Nevada mansion, driving a borrowed Bentley, and taking selfies with fans. Mark Seal chronicles this latest chapter in a surreal American saga.
Kaelin's story seemed to contradict Simpson's version of the events on some key points, as Kaelin testified that he could not account for Simpson's whereabouts between 9:36 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on the evening the murders took place, which the prosecution alleged occurred between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.

Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (11 October 1884 â 7 November 1962) was a social activist, first lady and the wife of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Any time youâre feeling down, youâre probably focusing on the wrong side of the ledger. Youâre focused on the things that have not gone the way you wanted, things that didnât turn out, people who upset you, or things like that. Now youâre giving your consent to yourself to make you feel inferior.
Eleanor Roosevelt said it best, No one can make you feel inferior without your permission.. In other words, although the feelings are normal, it's what you do with them and how you process them that reconnect you to your power.
I'll try my best to explain :)   No one can make you feel like you are worthless unless you belive what they are saying. For example, if someone makes fun of a grade you goâ¦t, you could take it personally and feel inferior, or you could choose not to care and you wouldn't feel inferior; you wouldn't care. Making the world better, one answer at a time.
Quotes[edit] Do what you feel in your heart to be right â for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.. Understanding is a two-way street. Life was meant to be lived, and curiosity must be kept alive.
1 One thing life has taught me: if you are interested, you never have to look for new interests. They come to you. â¦ All you need to do is to be curious, receptive, eager for experience. And there's one strange thing: when you are genuinely interested in one thing, it will always lead to something else.  p. 14.
Up to a certain point it is good for us to know that there are people in the world who will give us love and unquestioned loyalty to the limit of their ability. I doubt, however, if it is good for us to feel assured of this without the accompanying obligation of having to justify this devotion by our behavior.
If you decide that word âsmellsâ bad, you may end up feeling bad. In doing so, you give the word, and therefore the person, your consent to make you feel inferior. You could just as easily decide the word smells nice, or at least neutral, denying the word, and therefore the person, your consent. It really is that easy.
First, for consent to be free, you must be old enough to consent. The age of consent varies according to country, state, and type of contract. Second, in order for consent to â¦be free, you must not be coerced, or forced.

A per diem â and again, these are for millionaires â that is usually more than half of what big market team dance members make per game. Earlier this year, Deadspin detailed the ridiculous give and take that NFL cheerleaders have to work through in order to put â2009-2011; Baltimore Ravens Dance Sqaudâ on their resume.

Dancers can augment their income in selected team-sponsored events, but thatâs hardly much to directly deposit home about. Mock these women and this profession all you want â but these dancers are basically working for stipend money for NBA franchises that are valued for hundreds of millions of dollars.
Dance teachers must be in excellent physical shape, have a passion for dancing, have excellent flexibility, and be able to teach people in the age category in which they provide instruction. Dance teachers may work indoors and/or outdoors depending on their company, and they may work in a variety of categories of dance.

It is incorrect to call an image a negative solely because it is on a transparent material. Transparent prints can be made by printing a negative onto special positive film, as is done to make traditional motion picture film prints for use in theaters. Some films used in cameras are designed to be developed by reversal processing, which produces the final positive, instead of a negative, on the original film.

Origin of 'Beware the Ides of March'. We've all heard the saying, ' beware the Ides of March .' It's one of the most popular quotes from William Shakespeare, a man who may honestly be one the most quoted authors in history. The actual quote is from Shakespeare's tragedy Julius Caesar (1599).
A more well known occurrence on the Ides of March, in 44 B.C., Julius Caesar was assassinated, at the foot of a statue of Pompey where the Senate was meeting.* Before Caesar went to the theater of Pompey to attend the Senate meeting, he had been given advice not to go, but he didn't listen.
Julius Caesar, theâdictator for lifeâof the Roman Empire, is murdered by his own senators at a meeting in a hall next to Pompeyâs Theatre. The conspiracy against Caesar encompassed as many as sixty noblemen, including Caesarâs own protege, Marcus Brutus. Caesar was scheduled to leave Rome to fight in a war on March 18 and had appointed loyal members of his army to rule the Empire in his absence. The Republican senators, already chafing at having to abide by Caesarâs decrees, were particularly angry about the prospect of taking orders from Caesarâs underlings.
~ Anna Perenna Festival. In ancient Rome, a festival for Anna Perenna was held on the Ides of March. Ovid, a poet and contemporary of Rome's first emperor, Augustus, wrote a collection of Greek myths in Latin called the Metamorphoses.
Changing Significance of the Ides of March. 1  Before the historical assassination of Julius Caesar, the Ides of March was: 2  A division of the calendar based on the phases of the moon. 3  In some months, the Ides is on the 15th, and in others, it is the 13th.
In the tragedy Julius Caesar written by William Shakespeare, and supposedly also in real life, Caesar was warned by a soothsayer to 'beware the Ides of March.' Caesar was killed on March 15th, and in Roman culture, the 'Ides' typically meant a day falling between the 13th and 15th of the month.
âBeware the Ides of March,â the soothsayer urges Julius Caesar in Shakespeareâs Tragedy of Julius Caesar (act I, scene ii). Despite the forewarning, Caesar is stabbed in the back by his friend Marcus Brutus.
Gaius Julius Caesar, dictator of Rome, is stabbed to death in the Roman Senate house by 60 conspirators led by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus.

The first period, known as Mesolithic 1 (Kebarian culture; from 20,000â18,000 BCE until 12,150 BCE), followed the Aurignacian or Levantine Upper Paleolithic periods throughout the Levant. By the end of the Aurignacian, gradual changes took place in stone industries.

By the time of Vere Gordon Childe's work, The Dawn of Europe (1947), which affirms the Mesolithic, sufficient data had been collected to determine that the Mesolithic was in fact necessary and was indeed a transition and intermediary between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. Characteristics
In archaeology, the Mesolithic (Greek: Î¼Î­ÏÎ¿Ï, mesos middle; Î»Î¯Î¸Î¿Ï, lithos stone) is the period between Paleolithic and Neolithic. The term Epipaleolithic is often used for areas outside northern Europe, but was also the preferred synonym used by French archaeologists until the 1960s.
The second period, Mesolithic 2, is also called the Natufian culture. The change from Mesolithic 1 to Natufian culture can be dated more closely. The latest date from a Mesolithic 1 site in the Levant is 12,150 BCE. The earliest date from a Natufian site is 11,140 BCE.

Neolithic Period, also called New Stone Age, final stage of cultural evolution or technological development among prehistoric humans. It was characterized by stone tools shaped by polishing or grinding, dependence on domesticated plants or animals, settlement in permanent villages, and the appearance of such crafts as pottery and weaving.
Dubbed Avgi by archaeologists, she lived around 7000 BC, the end of the Mesolithic period. Her name is Greek for dawn, and she is so called because she lived at whatâs considered the dawn of civilization.

Details & Specs. The Sherpa-lined Hooded Jacket buries the needle on the comfort meter! A new category of comfort: The Sherpa-lined Hooded Jacket buries the needle on the comfort meter! We're talking maximum, off-the-charts comfort levels here! Imagine combining Dad's old flannel with your favorite hoodie, and then lining it with the softest, coziest blanket in your house. Yeah. The Sherpa-lined Hooded Flannel Jacket is THAT comfortable. And thread for thread, it's a hard-to-beat value, too... PRICED RIGHT for an instant antidote to cold, dreary days! 1  100% cotton shell.
âSherpa lining,â in the garment industry, refers to a polyester lining with a deep pile and large, fuzzy ânapsâ that give it a bumpy texture. The overall effect is similar to real sheepâs wool, but sherpa lining is lighter weight, much less bulky, and faster-drying. Itâs also considerably cheaper, and avoids any ethical concerns about animal products.
Your basic menâs sherpa jacket is thigh-length and straight-sided, with a full front zipper, slit hand pockets, and flap breast pockets. Most also have interior breast pockets â you get a lot of cargo space with your sherpa jacket. The collars are turndown and lined with the same sherpa lining as the interior. That feature is both decorative (it gives the coat a fluffy âwinterâ look) and functional (the fast-drying sherpa lining wonât get sodden from snow or condensing breath as quickly as a cotton collar).

Carhartt Flannel Lined clothing is slightly thicker than Carhartt Sherpa Lining. Quilted-flannel lined has the feel of a soft flannel shirt but is much warmer. It's also the 2nd thickest lining Carhartt makes for your flannel-lined jacket, flannel-lined shirt or flannel-lined jeans and pants. Carhartt flannel lined is quilted to a layer of polyester insulation for extra warmth. The flannel lining is made of flannel, as the name indicated. Not just any flannel though, Carhartt's most durable and thick flannel. This lining will ensure warmth no matter what temperature or environment you're working in.
Carhartt Thermal Lined clothing is the thinnest and least warm lining Carhartt makes. It has a thickness, and softness comparable to a Carhartt flannel shirt. This lining is perfect for keeping heat bottled inside, and keeping your body warm at all times.
Sherpa jackets are a winter staple, particularly in the northern United States and in Canada. You wonât find them in the photo spreads of glossy fashion magazines very often, but in places where getting work done and staying warm is a daily necessity, sherpa jackets are actually among the more attractive options.
SHerpas are a culture of people in Nepal, they do not own sheep or goats. Yaks at most, and that is not yak like fur trim. No way. Anyhow, sherpa lining is used in Baby Gap and other stores for soft and light fuzzy lining.
Carat. The third 'C' of diamonds is carat. Carat is a unit of weight where 1 carat = 200 milligrams. Carat weight will loosely corresponds to the 'size' of the diamond but size (and shape) will also depend on the stone's cut.
They could range anywhere from $2500 to $7200. There is a large difference in price due to other factors such as the symmetry, polish, girdle thickness, and presence of any flourescence. This should give you a good idea though of the range of the cost per carat.
The price range for 1 carat diamonds is between $3,080 and $26,950 per carat. Round Brilliant Cut stones have a 6.5mm diameter. 1 carat diamonds are often sold because they make for great shoulder stones.
Fancy Yellow diamonds, on the other hand, will price out similar to G color white diamonds. See these two examples: 1) 1.24 Carats, Fancy Yellow, VS1 Clarity, Radiant Cut, GIA Certified â $6300. 2) 1.13 Carats, G Color, VVS1 Clarity, Radiant Cut, GIA Certified â $5790. Similarly, its possible even to find a Fancy Intense Yellow Diamond that compares in price to an F or G color white diamond.
See the diamond pictured to the right, for example. It is a 1.02 carat, fancy vivid yellow, VS2 clarity, GIA Certified Cushion Cut. This stone is priced at $19,850 due to its unusually strong and beautiful color. A 1 carat cushion cut diamond with a D color and Flawless Clarity costs in the vicinity of $10,000 to $12,000.
The 4th 'C' of diamonds, clarity, is a measure of the amount, size, color and position of blemishes and 'inclusions' in the stone. Inclusions are small bits of other minerals or metals that are formed along with the diamond. Most diamonds have at least a few imperfections, even if only visible in extreme magnification.
For a higher carat stone, the difference in cost between a flawless diamond and a VVS diamond can be several thousand dollars or more. This is why, whether for your engagement ring, an anniversary, or simply a splendid gift, VVS1 and VVS2 diamonds are the smart choice for anyone seeking a perfect high end diamond.
VS1 - VS2: You can see flaws with a 10X microscope, but it takes a long time (more than about 10 seconds). SI1 - SI2: You can see flaws with a 10X microscope. I1 - I3: You can see flaws with the naked eye. Consider avoiding I2-I3 diamonds. REMEMBER: For grades IF through SI, a diamond's clarity grade has an impact on the diamond's value, not on the unmagnified diamond's appearance. While Flawless diamonds are the rarest, a diamond does not have to be flawless to be stunning.
The per carat value needs to be multiplied by the number of carats; in this case multiplied by 1. The average wholesale price of a GIA Certified 1 carat diamond would range between $3,080 and $26,950. Fill out the form for a FREE QUOTE and get an accurate pricing at Wholesale Price.
Fancy Light Yellow diamonds, for example, will price out similar to a J color white diamond. Take these two stones as examples: 1) 1.21 Carats, Fancy Light Yellow, VS2 Clarity, Radiant Cut, GIA Certified â $4460. 2) 1.21 Carats, I Color, VS1 Clarity, Radiant Cut, GIA Certified â $4300.
Described by Keenan as the space where my Id, Ego, and Anima all come together to exchange cookie recipes, Puscifer first appeared as the name of a fictional band Keenan fronted in a cameo on the HBO sketch comedy series Mr. Show in 1995.
XXXX-Now. Rock. While one might imagine Maynard James Keenan would have enough going on to keep him busy as a frontman with the groups Tool and A Perfect Circle, in 2007 he decided to record an album under yet another name with Puscifer.
Puscifer's original name was Umlaut, a premiere improvisational hardcore band. The name Puscifer was first publicized as a fictional band in the first episode of Mr. Show, including Keenan and Adam Jones as members. Jones is not associated with Puscifer otherwise, although artwork by Jones has been featured on Puscifer apparel (the Your Mom's a Bitch shirt, specifically).
Puscifer is as much a clothing line as it is a band, with the clothing items produced in limited numbers.
Later the same month, Puscifer's debut album, V Is for Vagina, was released; like the single, it was released in the United States by Keenan's own Puscifer Entertainment label, and it featured ten original songs, many of which were dominated by slow but potent dance grooves rather than Tool's prog metal textures.
Puscifer /ËpÊsÉ¨fÉr/ is a band (not a side project) of Maynard James Keenan, known for his work with the bands Tool and A Perfect Circle. As Keenan is the only permanent member, he considers the project to be his creative subconscious.. In light of this, Puscifer could be considered a pseudonym for his solo work.
Later the same month, Puscifer 's debut album, V Is for Vagina, was released; like the single, it was released in the United States by Keenan 's own Puscifer Entertainment label, and it featured ten original songs, many of which were dominated by slow but potent dance grooves rather than Tool 's prog metal textures.
Artist Biography by Mark Deming. While one might imagine Maynard James Keenan would have enough going on to keep him busy as a frontman with the groups Tool and A Perfect Circle, in 2007 he decided to record an album under yet another name with Puscifer.
In April of 2008, a remix album of V Is for Vagina titled V Is for Viagra: The Remixes was released and featured contributions from members of Nine Inch Nails, Telefon Tel Aviv, Ministry, and Slipknot, among others.
It wasn't until 2003 that Keenan actually recorded under the name, when he teamed up with Danny Lohner for a track called Rev 22:20 for the Underworld soundtrack, and it wasn't until four years later that he set to work on an entire Puscifer album.

Marine Corps infantry is not broken, so letâs not âfixâ it.

Until that gap is identified, I do not believe it is in the Nationâs interest to allow women in the infantry.
As the pinnacle fighting elements of the Marine Corps, it is in the best interest of the infantry units to mitigate the opportunities for sexual assault/harassment. If women are part of infantry units, it will be a matter of when, not if, more sexual assault cases will happen.

Valence Definition. Valence is typically, the number of electrons needed to fill the outermost shell of an atom. Because exceptions exist, the more general definition of valence is the number of electrons with which a given atom generally bonds or number of bonds an atom forms. (Think iron, which may have a valence of 2 or a valence of 3.) The IUPAC formal definition of valence is the maximum number of univalent atoms that may combine with an atom. Usually, the definition is based on the maximum number of either hydrogen atom or chlorine atoms. Note the IUPAC only defines a single valence value (the maximum), while atoms are known to be capable of displaying more than one valence. For example, copper commonly carries a valence of 1 or 2.
What made you want to look up negative valence? Please tell us where you read or heard it (including the quote, if possible).
O where m is zero to one, D is a divalent metal, d is from zero to 4, T is a trivalent metal, A represents at least one anion or negative-valence radical of valence n, where n is 1 or more, (m+2d+3+n.a) is equal to or greater than 3, (m+d) is greater than zero, and xHÂ¿2?
Chemistry. 1  the quality that determines the number of atoms or groups with which any single atom or group will unite chemically. 2  the relative combining capacity of an atom or group compared with that of the standard hydrogen atom.

Valence, as used in psychology, especially in discussing emotions, means the intrinsic attractiveness/good-ness or averseness/bad-ness of an event, object, or situation. The term is also used to characterize and categorize specific emotions. For example, the emotions popularly referred to as negative, such as anger and fear, have negative valence. Joy has positive valence. Positively valenced emotions are evoked by positively valenced events, objects, or situations. The term is also us
For metals, it is more convenient to define valency in terms of the number of chlorine atoms with which one metal atom combines to form their normal chlorides. Thus, the valencies of sodium, magnesium and aluminium are 1, 2 and 3 as they form NaCl, MgCl2 and AlCl3 in the atomic ratios 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 respectively.
Definition of positive valence. 1 :  the valence of a positively charged ion. 2 : the number of electrons an atom can give up sodium has a positive valence of 1.

What the Hell Happened to...Sherman Douglas? Long before Rajon Rondo attempted any of his floaters it was this guy, the General, that was known as the master of the push-shot. If you watched Big East basketball in the late 80s, you would've remembered him running the point guard for the Orangemen of Syracuse. If you followed the Celtics back in the 90s, you absolutely remember Sherman Douglas. After attending Spingarn High School in Washington DC, he would go on to Syracuse where he teamed up with Rony Seikaly, Stephen Thompson, Billy Owens and Derrick Coleman under coach Jim Boeheim for some very talented college teams.

But not only men, but women, opposed the idea of votes for women: Against Women Suffrage Because women already have the municipal vote, and are eligible for membership of most local authorities.
There were of course many people who opposed the idea of women s suffrage. They were known as the Antis. Here are some of the reasons they gave: 1. Women would be corrupted by politics and chivalry would die out 2.
But not only men, but women, opposed the idea of votes for women: Because women already have the municipal vote, and are eligible for membership of most local authorities.
By 1869 the women's rights movement had split into two factions: the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), led by Stanton and Anthony, and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), supported by Lucy Stone and Antoinette Brown Blackwell.
When the suffragettes began to win support, those opposing them had to take them more seriously. These are the arguments they came up with. Some of them might seem silly to you, but they made a lot of sense to people at the time: - Women and men have separate spheres. - Most women do not want the vote.
The Antebellum Era. Yet the women's rights movement did not begin in a single place nor did it focus exclusively on the vote. The process of mobilizing a women's rights movement was, in fact, far more complex. Before the Civil War, activists organized local and national women's rights conventions in Indiana, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
Pro-Suffrage Arguments. The women arguing for suffrage were taking to the streets by 1912, trying to convince other Americans that their cause had merit and support.
For almost 100 years, women (and men) had been fighting to win that right: They had made speeches, signed petitions, marched in parades and argued over and over again that women, like men, deserved all of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.
Women's Rights Movements. The American women's rights movement is usually dated from the convention held in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848 to discuss the Social, Civil, and Religious Condition of Woman..

In A Midsummer Night's Dream, love is a force that characters cannot control, a point amplified by workings of the love potion, which literally makes people slaves to love. And yet, A Midsummer Night's Dream ends happily, with three marriages blessed by the reconciled fairy King and Queen.
Plays Within Plays. A Midsummer Night's Dream is a play containing other plays. The most obvious example is the laborers' performance of Pyramus and Thisbe, and their inept production serves three important functions in the larger structure of the larger play.
Coelho also emphasizes a universal language in The Alchemist, one that all creation speaks. The Earth is alive and has a soul, and all parts of the Earth, from the wind to the sun to the sea to us, are all interconnected as one.
Animism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of some indigenous tribal peoples, especially prior to the development of organized religion.
God, the Father Almighty, is also very important in The Alchemist, but in a different way than many of us are accustomed to. In the novel, Coelho tells us that God exists everywhere, not just watching us from above, but interconnected with the whole world.
Herbert's quantum Animism presents the idea that every natural system has an inner life, a conscious center, from which it directs and observes its action.
According to Tylor, animism often includes an idea of pervading life and will in nature; i.e., a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls. This formulation was little different from that proposed by Auguste Comte as  fetishism , although the terms now have distinct uses.
Animism in the broadest sense, i.e., thinking of objects as animate, and treating them as if they were animate, is near-universal. Jean Piaget applied the term in reference to an implicit understanding of the world in a child's mind which assumes that all events are the product of intention or consciousness.
The relationship between men and women echoes across both the mortal and fairy worlds of A Midsummer Night's Dream. More specifically, both the fairy and mortal plots in the play deal with an attempt by male authority figures to control women.
She argues that animism is a relational epistemology, and not a Tylorian failure of primitive reasoning. That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self.

Plot Summary. 1  Drama about airline pilot who is married to two separate women in separate towns and who eventually takes on a third wife. 2  Nick Rawlings is a commercial airline pilot who has a stable home life in Dallas with wife of 16 years, JoBeth, and their son. He has also been married for three years to Allison, a Chicago business executive, and is about to tie the knot with a young blonde named Miriam who lives with her father in Hawaii.
For those married three or more times, it's more likely they have problems choosing someone appropriate or staying the course in intimate relationships. Marcy Miller, author of Rebooting in Beverly Hills: A Wise and Wild Path for Navigating the Dating World (Bancroft Press), has been married four times.
Dating in an age of multiple divorces. Navigating the dating scene when your date already has two or three marriages behind him. With divorce rates in the U.S. consistently reported at 30 to 50 percent, odds are pretty good that anyone on the dating scene is dancing, dining and moviegoing with someone who has been divorced, and often more than once.

Ms Behavin in TX 3 years ago. HE is the problem. There's a reason this guy has been divorced so many times and it is NOT because he is an optimist or a hopeless romantic. It's because he can't commit and is always looking for the next Mrs. Dumbass. There's a running theme: HIM!
I didn't assume anything you mentioned, and regardless of who divorced who, there are still 3 divorces which shows a pattern. Because the only thing the 3 divorces has in common, is that one person. So obviously that person is at fault somehow.
Basement sump pumps are another common type of basement drainage system. Basically, a sump pump is designed to not only prevent water from entering the basement in the first place, but also to automatically drain any water that manages to make its way in. These typically cost around $1,000 to install.
When the plumbing is in working order, all that needs to be done is removal of the old sink and the installation of a new unit. However, if the network of pipes under the sink has any problems such as leaks or breaks, homeowners should expect to pay much more for the full job. The average cost of replacing a sink is around $2,200 while installing new plumbing may cost $2,116.
Trench Drain length. Hey all, not in all my searching could I find the answer to this. The space we are looking at for our 7bbl brewhouse (3 vessel HLT, MT, and kettle) will need floor drains installed. After reading how much better trench drains are, I've gotten a quote for 100.00/linear foot installed.
Drainage Installation Costs. Whether making planned kitchen renovations or calling a plumber in an emergency, drainage installation can be a big investment. A large repair bill can catch any homeowner unaware and put a big dent in the household budget.
An interior basement drainage system should also be implemented for maximum protection. These basement waterproofing systems add a layer of protection around the basement's floor and wall joints, which is where flooding tends to begin. Installation of a new interior drainage system can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $10,000 depending on the size of the space.
If you plan on having basement drainage channels installed in your home while it is being constructed, the entire process can be completed for around $1,000 (for an average sized basement). Aftermarket drainage systems are more expensive due to the higher installation costs.
A hole will have to be dug in your basement floor (down underneath the foundation) at the low point of your basement. Expect to pay anywhere from $20 per linear foot up to $30 per foot for this work to be completed. Those cost figures do not include refinishing costs, however. Whatever was dug up to install the drainage system will have to be put back. This can cost anywhere from $500 up to $3,000 depending on the size of the area disturbed and whether or not it was a finished basement.
If all that needs replacing is the drain pipe right under the sink, a homeowner may only have to pay around $200 for the work. Contractor fees could push the price up a bit more, and the cost of materials varies by location. Those who are familiar with plumbing and have done similar work in the past may attempt the installation without help. However, this is one home repair job that often turns out to be bigger than it looks.
Cutting in new trench drains is nasty work. Much easier if there is no floor to begin with. For what it's worth, this is the trench drain system that we have planned: http://www.watts.com/pages/_products...=67&parCat=108 Click the Dead Level D link. It's expensive but saves a ton of labour in installation.
Essentially, a floor drain prevents water from leaking into the basement and is located below the basement floor to ensure maximum drainage. This type of drainage system is generally the least expensive, averaging just a few hundred dollars to have one installed.
Distribution of the Cyrillic script worldwide. The dark green shows the countries that use Cyrillic as the one main script; the lighter green those that use Cyrillic alongside another official script. Numerous Cyrillic alphabets are based on the Cyrillic script. The early Cyrillic alphabet was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School by the disciples of the Byzantine theologians Cyril and Methodius.

Modafinil reduces extreme sleepiness due to narcolepsy and other sleep disorders, such as periods of stopped breathing during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea).
PROVIGIL is a prescription medicine used to improve wakefulness in adults who are very sleepy due to one of the following diagnosed sleep disorders: narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or shift work disorder (SWD).More >>.
Modafinil is a medication that promotes wakefulness. Modafinil is used to treat excessive sleepiness caused by sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or shift work sleep disorder. Modafinil may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.
It is also used to help you stay awake during work hours if you have a work schedule that keeps you from having a normal sleep routine (shift work sleep disorder). This medication does not cure these sleep disorders and may not get rid of all your sleepiness. Modafinil does not take the place of getting enough sleep. It should not be used to treat tiredness or hold off sleep in people who do not have a sleep disorder. It is not known how modafinil works to keep you awake.
Stop using modafinil and call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects: 1  fever, sore throat, headache, and vomiting with a severe blistering, peeling, and red skin rash; 2  bruising, severe tingling, numbness, pain, muscle weakness;  easy bruising or bleeding;
Welcome to PROVIGIL.com. PROVIGIL is used to treat excessive sleepiness, but not the obstruction or medical condition that is causing OSA. PROVIGIL does not take the place of treatments that your doctor has prescribed for OSA. It is important that you continue to use these treatments as prescribed by your doctor.
A medicine similar to modafinil has caused severe skin reactions serious enough to require hospitalization. Other signs of a severe reaction include fever, sore throat, headache, and vomiting with a severe blistering, peeling, and red skin rash. There may be other drugs that can interact with modafinil.
Stop using modafinil and call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects: 1  fever, sore throat, headache, and vomiting with a severe blistering, peeling, and red skin rash;  bruising, severe tingling, numbness, pain, muscle weakness;

Or, if your doctor directs you to, the total daily dose of modafinil may be divided into a morning dose and a noon dose. For obstructive sleep apnea, take this medication by mouth with or without food as directed by your doctor, usually once daily in the morning.
Post Acute Withdrawal (PAW) Symptoms Many symptoms of alcohol and drug withdrawal are the result of the toxic effects these chemicals have on the brain and the body. In the first days and weeks following cessation of drug and alcohol use, individuals may experience acute withdrawal symptoms, which can be more severe for some than others and will vary depending upon the drug of choice among other factors.
Any of the following may trigger a temporary return or worsening of the symptoms of post-acute withdrawal syndrome: 1  Stressful and/or frustrating situations. 2  Multitasking. 3  Feelings of anxiety, fearfulness or anger. 4  Social conflicts. 5  Unrealistic expectations of oneself.
As acute withdrawal symptoms fade, post-acute withdrawal symptoms (PAWS) may be an issue for people in recovery. These symptoms, too, will vary in characteristic and degree based upon a number of factors.
The protracted withdrawal syndrome from benzodiazepines can produce symptoms identical to generalized anxiety disorder as well as panic disorder. Due to the sometimes prolonged nature and severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal, abrupt withdrawal is not advised. Common symptoms of post-acute withdrawal syndrome are:

Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome. Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome (PAWS), or the terms post-withdrawal syndrome, protracted withdrawal syndrome, prolonged withdrawal syndromes describe a set of persistent impairments that occur after withdrawal from alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines, antidepressants and other substances.
Post-Acute Withdrawal Symptoms. Some people may experience a prolonged or protracted withdrawal syndrome (sometimes referred to as post-acute withdrawal syndrome) that can last for weeks or months. 5. The symptoms in this phase are primarily emotional or psychological and include:
Post Acute Withdrawal (PAW) are symptoms of withdrawal that occur long after the initial 'acute' phase. PAWS are more psychological, long lasting and subtle. Post Acute Withdrawal (PAW) are symptoms of withdrawal that occur long after the initial 'acute' phase. PAWS are more psychological, long lasting and subtle. (888) 966-8152

Acamprosate has been found to be effective in alleviating some of the post acute withdrawal symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Carbamazepine or trazodone may also be effective in the treatment of post acute withdrawal syndrome in regards to alcohol use.
5. Ocean currents -- global temperature variations over the past century-and-a- half and particularly the past 30 years were due to the slow-down of the ocean's Thermohaline Circulation (THC). 6. Planetary motion -- natural gravitational and magnetic oscillations of the solar system induced by the planet's movement through space drive climate change.
climate change patterns from 10,000 BP to the present The Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 7,000 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era â and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. evidence of global warming from around the world Sea level rise: Global sea level rose about 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in the last century.
Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time. Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather within the context of longer-term average conditions. Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have been identified as primary
Prior to about 450,000 years before present time (BP) atmospheric CO2 levels were always at or below 260 ppmv and reached lowest values, approaching 170 ppmv, between 660,000 and 670,000 years ago. The highest pre-industrial value recorded in 800,000 years of ice-core record was 298.6 ppmv, around 330,000 years ago.
Previous major global climate changes were glacial cycles that happened long before human civilization developed. The human species evolved during the last 2.5 million years. Our far distant ancestors survived through multiple gradual cycles of cold ice ages, but did not experience any previous hot ages..
Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather around longer-term average conditions (i.e., more or fewer extreme weather events). Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions.
The term climate change is often used to refer specifically to anthropogenic climate change (also known as global warming). Anthropogenic climate change is caused by human activity, as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of Earth's natural processes. In this sense, especially in the context of environmental policy, the term climate change has become synonymous with anthropogenic global warming.
Life affects climate through its role in the carbon and water cycles and through such mechanisms as albedo, evapotranspiration, cloud formation, and weathering. 1  Examples of how life may have affected past climate include:
historical CO2 trends. Over the last 800,000 years atmospheric CO2 levels as indicated by the ice-core data have fluctuated between 170 and 300 parts per million by volume (ppmv), corresponding with conditions of glacial and interglacial periods.
Global average temperatures were 10-12 Â°C hotter than today. Most places on land were so hot that humans would risk fatal heat stroke every summer. The geological record shows many ancient changes in climate, including massive ice ages, hot-house conditions, oxygen-free and acidic oceans, and massive extinction events. These changes happened millions of years before humans, most occurred before even primitive mammals, appeared on the scene. Previous climate changes were caused by orbital wobbles, solar fluctuations, and movement of continents. None of those effects are causing the current heating http://sks.to/past.

Pure Sine Inverters. 12 Volt Pure Sine Power Inverters. 24 Volt Pure Sine Power Inverters. 48 Volt Pure Sine Power Inverters. 220v 50hz Pure Sine Power Inverters. All Pure Sine Power Inverters. On the downside, pure sine wave inverters are more expensive than the other two types of inverters.
Where power inverter devices substitute for standard line power, a sine wave output is desirable because many electrical products are engineered to work best with a sine wave AC power source. The standard electric utility power attempts to provide a power source that is a good approximation of a sine wave.
Store SO SKU # 228757. The Sunforce Pro Series 1000 Watt Pure Sine Wave Inverter powers your AC appliances or electronics directly from your 12 volt battery. Pure Sine Wave inverters provide clean power with very low harmonic distortion, no static or humming noise.
The modified sine inverter is different from a pure sine power inverter because the wave is in more of a step wave and because appliances are not specifically designed to work with this type of inverter. Although many appliances will still work with a modified sine inverter, some may not work as efficiently.
Sine wave inverters with more than three steps in the wave output are more complex and have significantly higher cost than a modified sine wave, with only three steps, or square wave (one step) types of the same power handling.
Rated 5.0 out of 5.0 by nickgt7 About this Inverter I purchased this inverter 1000 watt Pure Sine Wave Inverter Pro Series to use in emergency times when the power was out. But I also like to experiment with things.
A sine wave, which is produced by rotating AC machinery, is the type of wave that is generally provided by the utility company with the help of a generator. The benefits of using a pure sine wave inverter include: 1  All equipment currently on the market is designed for use with sine waves.
A power inverter, or inverter, is an electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry. The inverter does not produce any power; the power is provided by the DC source.
Pure sine power inverters produce cleaner power than a modified sine power inverter, and our line of pure sine models will cover all the complex electronics that are part of our everyday lives.
A power inverter device which produces a multiple step sinusoidal AC waveform is referred to as a sine wave inverter. To more clearly distinguish the inverters with outputs of much less distortion than the modified sine wave (three step) inverter designs, the manufacturers often use the phrase pure sine wave inverter.
All stakeholders, including public utility comÂ­. missions, city councils, and utilities, can use this paper to understand. the key issues and terminology, as well as the various perspectives each. cost-effectiveness test provides, and how the cost-effectiveness tests. can be implemented to capture additional energy efï¬ ciency.
These five cost-effectiveness tests are the participant cost test (PCT), the. utility/program administrator cost test (PACT), the ratepayer impact measure test (RIM), the. total resource cost test (TRC), and the societal cost test (SCT).
The efficiency of this process is about 5.7 percent â not very Lean. This is typical of transactional processes. The good news is that decreasing the delay time is usually much easier and cheaper than speeding up the execution time.
When the focus of a project is to reduce cycle time, the idea is to reduce time required for the entire transaction. This concept may create difficulty for stakeholders involved in transactional projects because there is no physical, visible buildup of WIP.
Project success has attracted. the attention of many researchers over the past years. As defined from. Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, success is âa level of social. status, achievement of an objective, the opposite of failureâ. There. is no uniform measure to what constitutes project success or project. effectiveness.
In its simplest form, energy efficiency cost-effectiveness is measured by comparing the benefits. of an investment with the costs. Five key cost-effectiveness tests have, with minor updates, been used for over 20 years as the principal approaches for energy efficiency program. evaluation.
SCE Program Benefits............................................................................................ C-3. Table C-3. SCE Program Cost-Effectiveness Test Results......................................................
Calculating Lean Process Capability. In a typical manufacturing environment, processes are considered Lean when the efficiency of the process is 25 percent or more. Total time includes the setup, changeover, maintenance and scheduled downtime. In a transactional environment, most of these measures have no counterpart. The equation is therefore modified to: A transactional process is considered Lean when the execution time is less than one third of the delay time, or about 25 percent of the cycle time.
The science of project management knows 20% using tools and the other. 80% require further research. Shenhar (2012) used an iceberg (figure. 1) in order to show the lack of investigation and a lot of research. needs to be carried out especially in the unknown variables that are. related to the bottom of the iceberg.

Even when all of the premises of an argument are reliably true, the argument may still be invalid if the logic employed is not legitimate â a so-called logical fallacy. The human brain is a marvelous machine with capabilities that, in some ways, still outperform the most powerful of super computers.
A logical fallacy is often what has happened when someone is wrong about something. It's a ï¬aw in reasoning. Strong arguments are void of logical fallacies, whilst arguments that are weak tend to use logical fallacies to appear stronger than they are. They're like tricks or illusions of thought, and they're often. very sneakily used by politicians, the media, and others to fool people.
It's a ï¬aw in reasoning. Strong arguments are void of logical fallacies, whilst arguments that are weak tend to use logical fallacies to appear stronger than they are. very sneakily used by politicians, the media, and others to fool people.
A quantification fallacy is an error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion. Types of Quantification fallacies: Existential fallacy â an argument that has a universal premise and a particular conclusion.
A propositional fallacy is an error in logic that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: <and>, <or>, <not>, <only if>, <if and only if>).
Structure of a Logical Argument. Whether we are consciously aware of it or not, our arguments all follow a certain basic structure. They begin with one or more premises, which are facts that the argument takes for granted as the starting point. Then a principle of logic is applied in order to come to a conclusion.
A fallacy is an incorrect argument in logic and rhetoric which undermines an argument's logical validity or more generally an argument's logical soundness. Fallacies are either formal fallacies or informal fallacies. These are commonly used styles of argument in convincing people, where the focus is on communication and results rather than the correctness of the logic, and may be used whether the point being advanced is correct or not.
It is only a fallacy to claim that an argument is wrong because of a negative attribute of someone making the argument. (i.e. âJohn is a jerk.â is not a fallacy. âJohn is wrong because he is a jerk.â is a logical fallacy.) The term âpoisoning the wellâ also refers to a form of ad hominem fallacy.
1 Argument to moderation (false compromise, middle ground, fallacy of the mean, argumentum ad temperantiam) â assuming that the compromise between two positions is always correct.  Argumentum ad hominem â the evasion of the actual topic by directing an attack at your opponent.
In order for an argument to be considered valid the logical form of the argument must work â must be valid. A valid argument is one in which, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true also. However, if one or more premise is false then a valid logical argument may still lead to a false conclusion. A sound argument is one in which the logic is valid and the premises are true, in which case the conclusion must be true.

Plate tectonics map with volcano locations indicated with red circles. Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent.
1 The pictures were an eloquent reminder of the power of the volcano. 2  Since the volcano last erupted, many houses have been built in a dangerous position on its slopes. 3  Lava from the volcano was flowing down the hillside.  The dust from the volcano spread northward.
For the 18th century geological theory, see Plutonism. Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent.

If magma reaches the surface, its behavior depends on the viscosity of the molten constituent rock. Viscous (thick) magma produces volcanoes characterised by explosive eruptions, while non-viscous (runny) magma produce volcanoes characterised by effusive eruptions pouring large amounts of lava onto the surface.
The lava flows associated with shield volcanos, such as Mauna Loa, on Hawaii, are very fluid. â A volcano composed of steep, alternating layers of lava and pyroclastic materials, including ash, is called a stratovolcano. Stratovolcanos are associated with relatively viscous lava and with explosive eruptions.

1 The pictures were an eloquent reminder of the power of the volcano. 2  Since the volcano last erupted, many houses have been built in a dangerous position on its slopes.  Lava from the volcano was flowing down the hillside.
An opening in the Earth's crust from which lava, ash, and hot gases flow or are ejected during an eruption. A usually cone-shaped mountain formed by the materials issuing from such an opening. Volcanoes are usually associated with plate boundaries but can also occur within the interior areas of a tectonic plate.

1.0 - Introduction. The Brimhaven dungeon is located just south-west of Brimhaven, and is packed with heaps of combat training areas. A preview of the monsters found in the dungeon are; Wild dogs, Moss giants, Fire giants, Greater demons, Baby red dragons, Red dragons, Bronze dragons, Iron dragons, and Steel dragons.
To begin with, you need any type of hatchet and at least 935gp. The money is for the boat ride to and from Brimhaven, and to pay Saniboch, while the hatchet is used to chop the vines within the dungeon.
Inside the Brimhaven dungeon, there are nine types of creatures, all found in order of difficulty. Wild dogs roam the entire dungeon, with the exception of the Steel and Iron dragon lair. Below is a thorough listing of the creatures, their training efficiency, and strategies on how to kill them.
As said before the new Karamja dungeon can be found south-west of Brimhaven, near a tribal camp. The most efficient way to arrive at Saniboch, is either to catch the boat from Ardougne to Brimhaven, or use a Glory amulet to teleport to N. Karamja.
There are a number of fire giants in the Brimhaven Dungeon, which requires a toll of 875gp per trip (exempt from toll if a player has ever acquired the Karamja Gloves 3) to access. These giants are now a good option for both training and slayer, as the wild dogs are unaggressive to players who are over combat level 71.
The Baxtorian Falls resource dungeon, located within the Waterfall Dungeon, contains 15 fire giants and requires level 35 Dungeoneering to enter. As it is inside the Waterfall Dungeon, the player must have done the appropriate parts of Waterfall Quest, as well as have Glarial's amulet, and a rope.

Confidence votes 32. iIf it's Fire Giants your after, the best place you can find them will be at Baxtorian Falls, near Tree Gnome Stronghold, you best be is making you way there from Ardougne, or if you have at least 20 Agility, Seers is ok as well. -Other Notes-.
This article is about the the standard variant. For the variant encountered while Dungeoneering, see Fire giant (Daemonheim) . Fire giants are the second strongest giants in RuneScape and they are well known for their combat and Slayer experience and gold charm drop rate.
With the update of the Brimhaven dungeon came the next part in the dragon armour series: Dragon platelegs. Soon after came the next part of dragon armour; the Dragon plateskirt.

(August 2016) The 5th Wave is a young adult science fiction novel by American author Rick Yancey, published in 2013, and is the first installment in The 5th Wave trilogy. Critics have compared the book favorably to The Hunger Games and The Road, and noted that it should do for aliens what Twilight did for vampires..
Poorly-paced, predictable, and teeth-gnashingly cheesy in moments of âhighâ emotional drama, The 5th Wave is representative of Hollywood studios doing the worst possible disservice to an author and a popular novel series in its efforts to bring the novelâs story to the screen.
Sheâs also a performer of considerable acting skill, which she demonstrates over and over again in The 5th Wave while making even the silliest, most contrived scenes, most of which center on the filmâs main romantic subplot, even remotely watchable.
Set roughly in present-day Dayton, Ohio, The 5th Wave follows 16-year-old Cassiopeia Cassie Sullivan as she tries to survive in a world devastated by the waves of an alien invasion that decimated the Earth's population.
As for Liev Schreiber, his talents are hardly challenged here.

Four waves of increasingly deadly attacks have left most of Earth in ruin. Against a backdrop of fear and distrust, Cassie is on the run, desperately trying to save her younger brother. As she prepares for the inevitable and lethal fifth wave, Cassie teams up with a young man who may become her final hope - if she can only trust him.
On the ocean, distances are calculated slightly different than on land, hence Nautical phrases are applied as opposed to land or Statute terminology. Nautical Mile (nm): A unit of distance used in navigation and based on the length of one minute of arc taken along a great circle. The value 1,852 meters (6,076.1 ft) has been adopted internationally. Statute mile: A unit of distance equal to 1,609 km (0.869 nm, 5,280 ft.). 1 nautical mile = 1.15 statute miles 1 statute mile = 1.6 kilometers. A knot is a unit of speed one nautical mile per hour, which is approximately 1.15 statute miles per hour.
They are identical terms for the same unit of measurement. A mile, as we know it today, is 5,280 feet. The difference between a mile and a statute mile is historical, rather than practical. Many hundreds of years ago, a mile meant different things to different people. It became necessary, eventually, for a mile to be the same distance for all concerned.
A nautical mile is one minute of arc at the earth's equator. Since there are 60 minutes in a degree and 360 degrees in a circle, the circumference of the earth is exactly 21,6â¦00 nautical miles by definition.
Science | Science Questions. NEXT PAGENEXT. A nautical mile is based on the circumference of the planet Earth. If you were to cut the Earth in half at the equator, you could pick up one of the halves and look at the equator as a circle. You could divide that circle into 360 degrees. You could then divide a degree into 60 minutes. A minute of arc on the planet Earth is 1 nautical mile. This unit of measurement is used by all nations for air and sea travel. A knot is a unit of measure for speed. If you are traveling at a speed of 1 nautical mile per hour, you are said to be traveling at a speed of 1 knot.
One nautical mile is equal to 1.15078 miles or 6,076.12 feet. In metric units, nautical mile is 1.85200 km or 1,852.00 meters. It is abbreviated to NM or nmi for convenience. Nautical miles are primarily used in navigation, in both naval and aerospace industries.
A nautical mile (NM) is the distance, of one minute (60 minutes =  one degree) of latitude along the Prime Meridian passing through  Greenwich, England. Ships at sea used seâ¦xtants and the stars to  determine latitude, so it was easy to measure distance using a unit  based on latitude.
Miles And Miles. The familiar land mile is 5,280 feet, is called a statute mile, and itâs based on paces. On the other hand, the nautical mile is used for distances on the ocean and doesnât have a tangible equivalent like paces. Itâs a mathematical calculation based on degrees of latitude around the equator. The equator is a circle, which we know has 360 degrees.
Nautical Mile vs. Mile. While mile is a unit of distance on land, a nautical mile is used to measure distances at sea. 1 nautical mile = 1.151 mi. 1  Kilometer vs Mile.  Celsius vs Fahrenheit.
Nautical Mile vs. Mile. Diffen âº Science âº Measurement. While mile is a unit of distance on land, a nautical mile is used to measure distances at sea. 1 nautical mile = 1.151 mi. Kilometer vs Mile.
Convert air miles to land miles. The formula is one air mile equals approximately 1.15 land miles. To illustrate, the air mile flying distance between Anchorage, Alaska, and Moscow, Russia, is 3,793 nautical miles. 3,793 times 1.15 equals 4,364. Therefore, Anchorage is 4,364 land miles from Moscow.

They generally live in small groups as opposed to nests or hives. The bugs lay eggs, and the eggs hatch into incredibly small nymphs, only about 1/16th of an inch long. The nymphs go through molten stages and grow into adult size in about 5 weeks. They reproduce quickly.
The bugs mostly feed on the blood of humans, but they have been known to drink the blood of other animals, such as bats, guinea pigs, chicken, cats, dogs, certain birds and rodents. They can survive as much as a year without food, though spending such a long time without feeding is not typical.

Ethanol as an Alternative Energy Source-Biofuels: Ethanol an Alternative Energy Source Abstract In today's society, when someone wants to go to the movies, work, school, library, or mall, they drive to their destination.
Ethanol Fuel-Missing Figures Ethanol Abstract: As of now we drive cars almost everywhere from home to the local store or different states. According to www.wikipedia.com there is âan estimated 243,023,485 registered passenger vehicles in the United States according to a 2004 DOT study!â 1That is a lot of cars.
For most ethanol industry observers, that announcement is consistent with the company's commitment to biofuels. The two plants combined will add 550 MMgy to ADM's current nameplate capacity of 1,215 MMgy for a grand total of 1,765 MMgy.
Biofuel factories use a huge amount of water four gallons for every gallon of ethanol produced. Despite 30 inches of rain per year in Iowa, there may not be enough water for corn ethanol factories as well as people and industry. Drought years will make matters worse (Cruse 2006).
It doesn't take that many more employees to staff a 55 MMgy plant than it does to staff a 110 MMgy plant. Most 55 MMgy plants employ 25 to 30 employees, while 110 MMgy facilities will only increase that to about 40 employees.
Most companies in the ethanol industry were building 55 MMgy and 60 MMgy plants a few years ago, increasing to 110 MMgy more recently. ADM's 275 MMgy dry-mill facility will be one of the biggest plants to come on line, once completed.
Iowa has a current production capacity of 2.3 billion gallons of ethanol, and another 1.14 billion under construction. Despite all of this ethanol being produced, about 2.1 billion bushels of corn left the state last year destined for export markets.
The new plant is a dry mill designed to be expandable up to 400 MMgy. The current 420 MMgy plant, a coal-fired, wet-mill facility, adds to this capacity, allowing for the production of 820 MMgy from a single site.
Sugar cane: too little to import. Brazil uses oil for 90% of their energy, and 17 times less oil (Jordan 2006). Brazilian ethanol production in 2003 was 3.3 billion gallons, about the same as the USA in 2004, or 1% of our transportation energy. Brazil uses 85% of their cane ethanol, leaving only 15% for export.
In addition to the $8.4 billion per year subsidies for corn and ethanol production, the consumer pays an additional amount for any product with corn in it (Pollan 20005), beef, milk, and eggs, because corn diverted to ethanol raises the price of corn for the livestock industry.

A tracheostomy is a procedure where a hole is made in the windpipe (trachea) and a tube inserted to aid with breathing. This keeps the airways open but can also remove any excess fluids produced by the lungs. A tracheostomy is often performed in an emergency.

Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries. The lateral relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100 mm annually.
Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the Greek: ÏÎµÎºÏÎ¿Î½Î¹ÎºÏÏ pertaining to building) is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motion of Earth 's lithosphere.

Go here to view a slide show on the evolution of Paricutin prepared by Scott Rowland. Sources of Information: Foshag, W.F., and Gonzalez-Reyna, J., 1956, Birth and development of Paricutin volcano: U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 965-D, p. 355-489.
Rarely do volcanologist get to watch the birth, growth, and death of a volcano. Paricutin provided such an opportunity. The eruption that created Paricutin began in 1943 and continued to 1952. Most of the explosive activity was during the first year of the eruption when the cone grew to 1,100 feet (336 m). The cone continued to grow for another 8 years but added only another 290 feet (88 m).
When pressure builds up, or tectonic plates shift, or where the crust is thin, volcanoes can erupt. There are 1,511 known volcanoes, 500 of which are active. Every now and then, a new one forms, as happened in 1943 in Paricutin, Mexico.
An earthquake occurs when tension along a plate boundary becomes too great, the rocks slip releasing energy. When cracks form in the crust, or one plate slips beneath another building up intense pressure and heat, volcanoes can erupt. To understand volcanoes, students need to understand the plate tectonics connection.
This theoretical model builds on the concept of continental drift which was developed during the first few decades of the 20th century. The geoscientific community accepted plate-tectonic theory after seafloor spreading was validated in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of a planet (the crust and upper mantle), is broken up into tectonic plates. The Earth's lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates.

The ring was then left on the ring finger. In a few European countries, the ring is worn on the left hand prior to marriage, then transferred to the right during the ceremony. A Greek Orthodox bride wears the ring on the left hand prior to the ceremony, then moves it to the right hand after the wedding. In Norway, Russia, Poland, Germany, Austria and in Spain (except in Catalonia) the wedding ring is worn on the ring finger on the right hand.
Though the left hand is considered inauspicious for religious activities, a ring (not to be called wedding ring) is still worn on the left hand. Men generally wear the rings on the right hand and the women on the left hands. If a wedding ring is worn, the ring is worn on the left ring finger mostly for men.

You wear the engagement ring there until the day of the ceremony, when you either move it to the right hand or put it somewhere safe so your new husband can place the wedding band on the left ring finger. After the ceremony, you put the engagement ring back, so that it is next to the wedding band. The band is traditionally put on first, then the engagement ring, because the band is supposed to be closer to your heart. The tradition of using the left hand is an old one.
Blessing the wedding ring and putting it on the bride's finger dates from the 11th century. In medieval Europe, during the Christian wedding ceremony the ring was placed in sequence on the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers of the left hand. The ring was then left on the ring finger. In a few European countries, the ring is worn on the left hand prior to marriage, then transferred to the right during the ceremony. For example, a Greek Orthodox bride wears the ring on the left hand prior to the ceremony, then moves it to the right hand after the wedding.
In some cultures the wedding ring is worn on the ring finger of the left hand, while in others it is on the right hand. Traditionally, a wedding ring was worn by the bride/wife on the ring finger, but in recent times more men also wear a wedding ring on the ring finger. It is also the custom in some cultures not to wear a ring on the ring finger unless one is married, though an engagement ring is usually also worn on the ring finger.

Introduction. Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of naturally occurring, small non-coding RNA molecules, about 21â25 nucleotides in length.icroRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as large RNA precursors called pri-miRNAs and comprise of a 5' cap and poly-A tail. The pri-miRNAs are processed in the nucleus by the microprocessor complex, consisting of the RNase III enzyme Drosha, and the double-stranded-RNA-binding protein, Pasha/DGCR8.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small ribonucleic acids, 21-25 nucleotides in length, that modulate protein expression through transcript degradation, inhibition of translation, or sequestering transcripts.icroRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) was developed to take advantage of next-generation sequencing or massively parallel high-throughput sequencing technologies in order to find novel miRNAs and their expression profiles in a given sample.
In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA hairpin is cleaved by the RNase III enzyme Dicer. This endoribonuclease interacts with 5' and 3' ends of the hairpin and cuts away the loop joining the 3' and 5' arms, yielding an imperfect miRNA:miRNA* duplex about 22 nucleotides in length.he mature miRNA is part of an active RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) containing Dicer and many associated proteins.

Czech Genetics: Abstracts and Summaries. The Czech Republic - consisting of the regions of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia - borders Germany, Austria, Poland, and Slovakia in the center of Europe. It's also known as Czechia. The Czech language is related to the Slovak language; both are members of the West Slavic language family.
Up to the 1960s, masses were crowded with German believers, but their number is gradually shrinking. The Ore Mountain Germans did not live quite in the Czech Republic, nor in Germany. This was not such a ground-shaking change for the Germans as it might seem, though.
âCzechsâ belong to handfull of slavic countries with strong germanic influence, but they are not âgermanicâ as turkish people are also not greek, despite the fact that a lot of them have greek ancestry. Czechs have some genetic and cultural influences from Germany, but theâre their own distinctive people.
Czech shepherds are typically known for their even temperament, intelligence, high energy and drive. The Czech shepherd breed is from the German working line of German shepherds and was bred to produce working dogs. They have a natural tendency to be protective and obedient, and they are also great trackers. These dogs excel as military or police dogs and serve well as assistance dogs.
Despite many Sudeten Germans being forced to leave at the end of the Second World War, a small German community survives in country's west. As their culture slowly disappears, those who remain look back at the decades of coexistence with the Czechs.
And going into a Czech bar, sitting at a table, taking a beer mat from the central container, and placing it in front of you, will frequently result in a half litre of Czech beer arriving, without you having to say a word! And be reassured â as far as Czech people are concerned, beer is not alcohol ð. 2. Get a title.
The database includes not only Czechs but also Slovaks, Austrians, Germans, Hungarians, Jews, and members of many other ethnic groups. Once you've joined Family Tree DNA and had your DNA tested, be sure to sign up for Leo Baca and Joni Hudson's Czech DNA Project if you're Czech!
Answer Wiki. 6 Answers. Interesting question, which made me realize that my answer is: nothing, really. Despite living in Bavaria, which shares a border with the Czech republic, I don't personally know any Czechs and haven't been there. I don't even know any stereotypes about Czechs. All I know is some basic history, that they have good beer and Prague is supposedly well worth visiting.

Cuisine in the Abbasid Period. The foundation of Baghdad in 762 A.D. had a significant impact on many aspects of Arab culture and Islamic culture in general, not least among them cuisine. The city was the melting pot of its day, drawing in people from all parts of the world and imbibing their customs, crafts, and recipes.
The Abbasid dynasty descended from Muhammad's uncle, Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib (566â653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name. They ruled as caliphs for most of their period from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after assuming authority over the Muslim empire from the Umayyads in 750 CE (132 AH).
Once you are done with this lesson you should be able to: 1  Identify the Abbasids. 2  Describe the roles of the caliphs and the viziers. 3  Explain how the caliphs' focus on trade led to the Golden Age of Islam. 4  Summarize the fall of the Abbasids.
Your next lesson will play in 10 seconds. 1  0:01 The Abbasids. 2  0:41 Caliphs & Viziers. 3  1:36 Golden Age of Islam. 4  2:36 Decline of the Empire. 5  3:05 Lesson Summary.
The Abbasid Caliphate differed from others in that it did not have the same borders and extent as Islam. Particularly, in the west of the Caliphate, there were multiple smaller caliphates that existed in relative peace with them.
Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasid Caliphate (/ÉËbÃ¦sÉªd/ or /ËÃ¦bÉsÉªd/ Arabic: Ù±ÙÙØ®ÙÙØ§ÙÙØ©Ù Ù±ÙÙØ¹ÙØ¨ÙÙØ§Ø³ÙÙÙÙØ©ââ al-KhilÄfatu al-âAbbÄsÄ«yah) was the third of the Islamic caliphates to succeed the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Abbasid dynasty descended from Muhammad's uncle, Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib (566â653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name. They ruled as caliphs, for most of their period from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after assuming authority over the Muslim empire from the Umayyads in 750 CE (132 AH).
Although many of us are familiar with the politics of the modern Middle East, I'm guessing most of us are not nearly as versed in its history. Today we'll try to rectify this a bit as we discuss the Abbasid Empire and their rulers, known as caliphs. To begin, the Abbasids ruled the Arab world from about 750 CE to 1258 CE. They took power after conquering the former empire of the Umayyads.
Abbasid food was not much different from what was eaten in pre-Islamic times. Baghdadisâ diet chiefly comprised of grains (wheat, barley, and to an extent, rice), and meat from domesticated animals. Bread was rare â to be called a âbread eaterâ was to be called affluent, and was hence a compliment.

1 Helper T cells augment the immune response by recognizing the presence of a foreign antigen and then stimulating antibody production and producing cytokines that âturn onâ or activate other T cells. 2  Regulatory T cells function in an opposite manner: they dampen or turn off the immune response.
The sponges are an ancient group with a fossil record back as far as the Precambrian. There are about 10,000 known species of marine sponges, and about 150 freshwater sponges. They are relatively abundant in all marine waters at all depths. They vary in size from a few millimetres to over two metres across.
A common dry cell is the zincâcarbon battery, sometimes called the dry Leclanche leclanchÃ©, cell with a nominal voltage of.1 5, volts the same as the alkaline (battery since both use the same â zinc manganese dioxide). combination
1 This type of canal system is found in the Calcarea Class (see below). 2  Synconoids, like asconiods, have a single, large osculum, but their body is thicker. 3  The drawing above shows a simple type on the left and a more complex type on the right.
Collagen /ËkÉlÉdÊÉ¨n/ is the main structural protein in the extracellular space in the various connective tissues in animals. As the main component of connective tissue, it is the most abundant protein in mammals, making up from 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content.
Gelatin, which is used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed. Collagen also has many medical uses in treating complications of the bones and skin. The name collagen comes from the Greek ÎºÏÎ»Î»Î± (kolla), kÃ³lla  meaning , glue and -suffix, -Î³Î­Î½, gen denoting. producing
Collagen is not only a structural protein. Due to its key role in the determination of cell phenotype, cell adhesion, tissue regulation and infrastructure, many sections of its non-proline-rich regions have cell or matrix association / regulation roles.
Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendons, ligaments and skin. It is also abundant in corneas, cartilage, bones, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs and the dentin in teeth. In muscle tissue, it serves as a major component of the endomysium.
Overview. Immune function is helped by two kinds of white blood cells. The âB cellsâ (so-called because they develop in bone marrow) produce antibodies. The âT cellsâ (so-called because they develop in a small organ called the thymus gland) are responsible for a variety of other immune responses. These responses include: 1  direct attacks on foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, or foreign tissues; 2  augmenting the B cell response; and.
Class Calcarea. As the name suggests sponges in this class have spicules of calcium carbonate. The spicules are either free or fused. They tend to be relatively small, mostly less than 10 cm, and tubular or vase-shaped. All three types of canal system occur in this class. There are about 100 species, mainly marine in water no deeper than 1000m.

An embryo is an animal in the phase after fertilization but before birth or hatching. Embryos still live in the womb or egg. Do you remember when you were an embryo? Probably not, because you were just a tiny clump of cells in your mother's womb â you weren't born yet.
A. cortex B. stem C. parenchyma D. xylem Weegy: A (b) stem holds the leaves of the plant up and it carries nutrients from the root system to the rest of the plant. User: _______ is the process in which plants convert the energy in sunlight into the energy in the chemical bonds of carbohydrates, e.g., starches and sugars.
In humans, a pregnancy is generally considered to be in the embryonic stage of development between the fifth and the eleventh weeks after fertilization, and is expressed as a fetus from the twelfth week.
An embryo is an early stage of development of a multicellular diploid eukaryotic organism. In general, in organisms that reproduce sexually, an embryo develops from a zygote, the single cell resulting from the fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell.
In a placental mammal, an ovum is fertilized in a fallopian tube through which it travels into the uterus. An embryo is called a fetus at a more advanced stage of development and up until birth or hatching. In humans, this is from the eleventh week of gestation.
In angiosperms, the process of seed development begins with double fertilization and involves the fusion of the egg and sperm nuclei into a zygote. The second part of this process is the fusion of the polar nuclei with a second sperm cell nucleus, thus forming a primary endosperm.
Food Storage in the Seed. The storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots . In monocots, the single cotyledon is called a scutellum; it is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue. Food reserves are stored in the large endosperm. Upon germination, enzymes are secreted by the aleurone, a single layer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo.
In animals, the development of the zygote into an embryo proceeds through specific recognizable stages of blastula, gastrula, and organogenesis. The blastula stage typically features a fluid-filled cavity, the blastocoel, surrounded by a sphere or sheet of cells, also called blastomeres.
Parts of a Seed. The seed, along with the ovule, is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac. In dicots, the seed coat is further divided into an outer coat, known as the testa, and inner coat, known as the tegmen.
All animals were embryos at one point: it's a very early stage of life. Another meaning is not as literal: the beginning of an idea could be called an embryo, as in, My plan for ice-skating robots is still in the embryo stage.. That means the idea isn't very developed. Definitions of embryo.

You can be a muse without having a perfectly-proportioned body and a pretty face. Whatever it is that makes you different, play it up. An artistâs quest is to create something the world has never seen, something truly original. An artistâs muse is not just a model or mannequin, but a source of original energy and life. For example, Pablo Picasso's series of muses, including Dora Maar and Marie-Therese Walter, helped him see the human body in a new way and inspired him to share his insights with the world.
Muse is a novel that displays a love and passion for literature by one of the most decorated members of the industry. Call it a passion project, a memoir of sorts, a love letter to beautiful writing: Galassi has been inspired by his Muse.â âSteven Petite, The Huffington Post. âFascinating . . . Muse is built around a charming premise: that an important American poet could become as famous as a pop star, a screen siren or an athlete. Here we are in the midst of fantasy, but a fantasy not far, as Galassiâs novel eloquently illustrates, from the one inhabited by people in the literature business.
A muse is someone who engages the artist on an intellectual level, spurring him or her to run with creative ideas that someone else wouldnât really understand. To be a muse, encourage the artist to explore more deeply, rather than pulling back. No discussion should be off-limits.
Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C8th or C7th B.C.) : Them [the Mousai (Muses)] in Pieria did Mnemosyne (Memory), who reigns over the hills of Eleuther, bear of union with the father [Zeus], the son of Kronos (Cronus), a forgetting of ills and a rest from sorrow.
That he manages to keep his literary Uber on the road and out of the ditches is a tribute to his skill as a writer and storyteller. Muse is a kind of mystery: not so much a who-done-it but a more satisfying who-felt-it, who-experienced-it, who-saw-it-for-what-it-really-was . . .
In current English usage, muse can refer in general to a person who inspires an artist, writer, or musician.
Muse, Muses, Of Song. Muse with barbiton, Paestan red-figure lekanis C4th B.C., MusÃ©e du Louvre. THE MOUSAI (Muses) were the goddesses of music, song and dance, and the source of inspiration to poets. They were also goddesses of knowledge, who remembered all things that had come to pass.
Muse is many things: a satire of New Yorkâs social world, a portrait of publishing that is both love song and takedown, and an intriguing mystery. But beneath the bookâs sometimes brittle surface lies the belief that literature can change lives. Yes, the business of books is changing.
Modern muses don't have to be beautiful deities, but they still have an ethereal, uninhibited quality that ignites creativity and draws out an artistâs most original work. If you want to be a muse, someone elseâs or your own, make creative openness and freedom your values to live by.
Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 39. 3 ff (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.) : The first to sacrifice on Helikon to the Mousai (Muses) and to call the mountain sacred to the Mousai were, they say, Ephialtes and Otos (Otus), who also founded Askra (Ascra).

No tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set for potassium by EFSA due to insufficient data (EFSA, 2005). The Panel considered that the risk of adverse effects from potassium intake from food sources (up to 5,000â6,000 mg (129â154 mmol)/day in adults) is low for the general healthy population.
The addition of sodium diacetate alone or in combination with other ingredients, such as sodium lactate or potassium lactate, has been shown to not effect or to have a very limited effect on meat color (Anwar et al, 2000; Grones et al., 2000).
Most of body potassium is located in the muscle, with lower amounts present in the bone, liver, skin and red blood cells. Because of tight homeostatic mechanisms, blood potassium concentrations and total body potassium content are only minimally affected by variations in dietary potassium intake.
Potassium lactate. Most of the early work examined the use of sodium lactate as a non-meat ingredient, but interest in adding a non-meat ingredient that did not increase the level of salt in the final product and that would not have any off-flavors associated with its use increased by the early 1990âs.
Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for the European population, including potassium. Potassium is an essential mineral in the human diet.
The major ingredients used in enhanced pork are water, sodium phosphates, salt, sodium lactate, potassium lactate, sodium diacetate and varying flavoring agents of which lemon juice has been singled out for use in some products.
Urine is the major route of potassium excretion, while the remaining part is eliminated in the faeces and, to a lesser extent, in the sweat. Urinary potassium excretion, based on 24-h urine collection, is regarded as a reliable biomarker of dietary intake in adults on a population basis.
Sebastian et al. studied the effect of potassium supplementation (6,084 mg (156 mmol)/day as potassium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for 8 days each) in six healthy males (25â40 years) on a fixed diet (3,220 mg (140 mmol) sodium, 2,024 mg (52 mmol) potassium, 361 mg (9 mmol) calcium, 836 mg (27 mmol) phosphorus per 70-kg body weight).
The Panel considers that interactions between potassium and other minerals and vitamins, in the context of a mixed European diet, are not relevant for setting dietary reference values (DRVs) for potassium. 2.4 Biomarkers 2.4.1 Biomarkers of intake
Potassium as potassium-l-ascorbate, magnesium potassium citrate, potassium iodide, potassium iodate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium chloride, potassium citrate, potassium gluconate, potassium glycerophosphate, potassium lactate, potassium hydroxide, potassium salts of orthophosphoric acid and potassium fluoride may be added to both foods3 and food supplements,4 whereas potassium sulfate, potassium l-pidolate, potassium malate and potassium molybdate may only be used in ...
Ruby Bridges' first few weeks at Frantz School were not easy ones. Several times she was confronted with blatant racism in full view of her federal escorts. On her second day of school, a woman threatened to poison her. After this, the federal marshals allowed her to only eat food from home.
Right, Under escort of Deputy U.S. Marshals, Ruby Bridges enters William Frantz school in New Orleans on Nov. 28, 1960, to resume class after a week's vacation. Only seven white children reportedly attended the two newly-integrated schools on this day.
The principal would not force the other first grade teacher to include Ruby in her class. Instead, the white children came into Mrs. Henry's classroom for part of each day. Mrs. Henry said, It was progress.. It was from these children that Ruby finally learned about racism and integration.
Ruby would be the only African-American student to attend the William Frantz School, near her home, and the first black child to attend an all-white elementary school in the South. When the first day of school rolled around in September, Ruby was still at her old school.

Before she knew it, it was June. When Ruby went back to school in September, everything was different: There were no marshals, no protestors. There were other kidsâeven some other black studentsâin her second-grade class. It was odd, but it was almost as if that first year of school integration had never happened. No one talked about it.
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: On November 14, 1960, the nation watched as six-year-old Ruby Nell Bridges walked into William Frantz Elementary School and into history. A federal court ordered the New Orleans school system to desegregate, making Bridges the first African-American to attend the elementary school.
It was Ruby Bridges' third day at her new school. On the first day her mother, Lucille, had gone with Ruby and the federal marshals. The night before, she had told Ruby, There might be a lot of people outside the school, but you don't need to be afraid. I'll be with you..
What is FICA? The Federal Insurance Contributions Act is the federal law that requires you to withhold two separate taxes from the wages you earn. It includes Social Security Tax and Medicare Tax at a flat percentage rate. The Social Security Tax is 6.2% rate of your wages, and the Medicare Tax is 1.45% of your wages. If you earn more than $200,000, you will also be taxed an additional 0.9% Medicare surtax. Youâre not the only one paying for FICA, however.
Security and Medicare (FICA) without deduction from. an employeeâs wages, the additional amount is not. considered an increase to the employeeâs wages. when calculating the Unemployment Insurance (UI), Employment Training Tax (ETT), or SDI taxes. When a household or agricultural employer pays SDI.
Social Security and Medicare Withholding Rates. The current tax rate for social security is 6.2% for the employer and 6.2% for the employee, or 12.4% total. The current rate for Medicare is 1.45% for the employer and 1.45% for the employee, or 2.9% total.
Social Security & Medicare Tax Rates. Social Security's Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program and Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) program are financed primarily by employment taxes. Tax rates are set by law (see sections 1401, 3101, and 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code) and apply to earnings up to a maximum amount for OASDI.
Security/Medicare (taxes imposed under the Federal. Insurance Contributions Act [FICA]), State Disability. Insurance* (SDI), and/or federal income taxes without. deduction from the employeeâs salary. The payments made. by the employer on behalf of the employee may constitute.
Taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) are composed of the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance taxes, also known as social security taxes, and the hospital insurance tax, also known as Medicare taxes. Different rates apply for these taxes.
FICA taxes are payroll taxes withheld from employee paychecks and paid by employees and employers for (1) Social Security (OASDI) and (2) Medicare. This article gives you information about how to calculate FICA taxes, how to report and pay these taxes, what earnings are not part of FICA taxes, and more.
The law requires employers to withhold taxes from employee earnings to fund the Social Security and Medicare programs. These are called Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes. Your employer also pays a tax equal to the amount withheld from employee earnings. The self-employed pay Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) taxes on net earnings. SECA taxes also fund Social Security and Medicare. The self-employed pay both the employee and the employer share of SECA. But the law permits them to deduct half of the self-employment tax as a business expense.
For 2011 and 2012, the OASDI tax rate is reduced by 2 percentage points for employees and for self-employed workers, resulting in a 4.2 percent effective tax rate for employees and a 10.4 percent effective tax rate for self-employed workers.
FICA taxes are the Social Security and Medicare taxes paid by individuals and employers. The total FICA tax is 15.3%. That percentage is applied to the employee's gross pay. Here is the breakdown of these taxes: The employer and employee each pays 7.65%. Breaking these percentages down further: The OASDI (Social Security) portion is 6.2%, up to the annual maximum wages subject to Social Security.

May 20, 2016 -- The tick responsible for Lyme disease is showing up in new areas in the U.S., a worrisome trend.
It is most prevalent in the northeastern and Midwestern states of the U.S., with about 96% of reported cases occurring in 14 states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin.
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread through the bite of one of several types of ticks. Lyme disease is caused by bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi (B burgdorferi). Blacklegged ticks and other species of ticks can carry these bacteria. The ticks pick up the bacteria when they bite mice or deer that are infected with B burgdorferi. You can get the disease if you are bitten by an infected tick.
Lyme disease is spread by these ticks when they bite the skin, which permits the transmission of the bacterium through the skin to infect the body. So Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease. Lyme disease is not contagious from an affected person to someone else. Lyme disease can cause abnormalities in the skin, joints, heart, and nervous system.
Doctors at New Haven's Yale Medical Center first described and named Lyme disease in the U.S. in 1977, after an unexpected number of residents in Lyme, Conn., were found to have a new and unusual illness. Medically Reviewed by a Doctor on 7/17/2015.
The Northeast continues to have the most concentrated areas of Lyme cases. But the black-legged tick is now present in nearly half of U.S. counties in 43 states, a jump of nearly 45% since 1998, according to a recent CDC report. The majority of the tick population growth has been in the North-central and Northeast.
Lyme disease is a bacterial illness caused by a bacterium called a spirochete.. In the United States, the actual name of the bacterium is Borrelia burgdorferi. In Europe, another bacterium, Borrelia afzelii, also causes Lyme disease. Certain ticks found on deer harbor the bacterium in their stomachs. Lyme disease is spread by these ticks when they bite the skin, which permits the bacterium to infect the body. Lyme disease is not contagious from an affected person to someone else. Lyme disease can cause abnormalities in the skin, joints, heart, and nervous system.
Lyme Disease History. Lyme disease, sometimes referred to as Lyme infection, is a bacterial illness, transmitted to humans by the bite of deer ticks (Ixodes ticks) carrying a bacterium known as Borrelia burgdorferi.
For most people, the disease causes flu-like symptoms. About 80% of people who get it fully recover by taking antibiotics, says John Aucott, MD, of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center. Mead and Aucott shared more about the disease and what to expect this year and beyond.

1 In response to the abuses of party machines, late-nineteenth-and early-twentieth-century Progressives pushed for reforms of the political system, including the Australian ballot, merit systems of civil service, and direct primaries that weakened party organizations. Political parties are institutions that seek to control the government through the winning of offices; whereas interest groups are âbenefit seekersâ looking for policy gains, parties tend to be composed of office seekers.
Introduction. Political parties are teams of politicians, activists, and voters whose goal is to win control of government. To do so, parties perform essential tasks of recruiting and nominating candidates, garnering the resources needed to run campaigns, and pursuing a policy agenda that can help them appeal to voters. Political parties are institutions that seek to control the government through the winning of offices; whereas interest groups are âbenefit seekersâ looking for policy gains, parties tend to be composed of office seekers.
Political machines in the United States [edit]. In the late 19th century, large cities in the United Statesâ Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York City, Philadelphia, St. Louis âwere accused of using political machines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. political machine is a party organization that recruits its members by the use of tangible incentivesâmoney, political jobsâand that is characterized by a high degree of leadership control over member activity.

For much of American history (until the early twentieth century), most news media were clearly and openly biased. Many newspapers, for example, were simply the voices of the political parties. This type of journalism is called partisan journalism.Other newspapers practiced yellow journalism, reporting shocking and sordid stories in order to attract readers and sell more papers.n the American political system, the media perform a number of functions important to the democratic process. The media reports the news, serves as an intermediary between the government and the people, helps determine which issues should be discussed, and keeps people actively involved in society and politics.

By 1936 conservative reaction to the national Democratic party erupted in the formation of the Jeffersonian Democrats. This national organization received significant aid from several prominent conservative Texas Democrats including John Henry Kirby, Joseph Weldon Bailey, Jr., and J. Evetts Haley.he Democratic party has played a central role in the political development of Texas since white Americans first settled the region. The majority of early settlers came from the American South and brought their past political allegiances with them.
The party history of the United States and of Texas can be understood as a series of long relatively stable periods interrupted by profound shifts in the composition of the major parties  which types of voters and interest groups consistently support each party  and their relative strength in the political system.he end of Reconstruction and the return of home rule by conservative whites in Texas kicked off a period of Democratic Party dominance that would last though the rest of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth century.

1. Measure your waist. Using measuring tape (flexible tape measure), measure the circumference around your waist (the narrowest point between your ribs and hips). This is probably about an inch above your belly button.
We go by what waist size we think they will fit. So if we think they will fit someone with a 26 waist, they will be marked as a size 26 in the title. If you'd like to know more, here are some specifics: More often than not, high waisted clothing sits lower than your actual waist line. Because of this, the waist measurement on a pair that will actually fit you will likely be .5-4 inches (1.27- 10.16 cm) bigger than your body's waist (I find that 2 inches / 5.08 cm is the most common difference).

Polysaccharides is another world for complex carbohydrates and is just one of the many goji berry benefits. We need complex carbohydrates in order for our bodies to grow and thrive. Polysaccharides are divided into two different types of complex carbohydrates include storage and structural.
They are normally seen as membranes that cover important organs but the study of bacterial capsule polysaccharides is one that is being conducted by the medical community to determine the role this has in disease. Bacterial infection is something that kills millions of people each year.
4. Pivot joints: These joints allow only one type of movement, the rotation of one bone on or around another. An example of a pivot joint is the joint between the atlas and axis (C1 & C2) vertebrae, the rotation around each other allows our heads to âpivotâ left and right. 5.
Patients with complement deficiency are at risk of infections with encapsulated organisms. There are several types of complement deficiency, two of note are C3 and C5,6,7,8,9. A C3 deficiency allows for infection by encapsulated organisms such as; Neisseria, Group B Strep, Klebsiella, Salmonella, HIB and Pneumococci. A C5,6,7,8,9 (the MAC, membrane attack complex, or terminal complement proteins) deficiency lead to unopposed Neisserial infections.
Polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria, frequently referred to simply as encapsulated bacteria and less precisely called encapsulated organisms, are a group of bacteria that have an outer covering, a bacterial capsule, made of polysaccharide.
These are found in different foods such as starches which consist of potatoes, rice and corn. We need these as dietary fiber. Glycogen is stored in our liver and our muscles and is another example of storage polysaccharides that are needed to stay alive.

These joints allow a very small amount of movement. 3. Synovial joints â the bones of synovial joints meet in a joint capsule, such as the knee joint where the femur and tibia meet. These joints are the most common and most moveable joints in the human body.

Inv + Potion of Deepholm = vanish + Potion of Deepholm = new bubble-hearth Comment by oaninor one big question, can i go to deepholme with this even if i wasn't be there?. my druid is lvl 80 and i want transmute volatile life for earth but obviously i cant go deepholme yet. can i use this?, or is like the portals that you must do the starting quest for use them?.
Just tested on beta on a premade monk that has never been to Deepholm, and without the breadcrumb quest in my logs, I was able to access the first quests in Temple of Earth. So yes, this potion will let you cheat the travel to Orgrimmar and the fly in quest.
The Potion of Treasure Finding will sometimes reward you with an extra Tiny Treasure Chest when you loot a monster, the chest contains 3-5 Gold, has a 75% chance to contain 8-15 Embersilk Cloth, and a 15% chance to contain a Volatile element.
Potion of Deepholm is a level 82 potion. In the Potions category. An item from World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Always up to date with the latest patch.
As long as the quests in deepholm arent chained to the one in org to go through the maelstrom. Sure. Even if not, its a minute cooldown, instant cast, and takes you straight to the Temple of Earth.
Trauma is more severe than being in the ER, from what I understand. I mean, most of the people in the ER are awake and can talk, they seem okay for the most part (from what can be seen.). But the patients in trauma are beyond ill. Most of the patients that end up in trauma where I am at are severe car accidents, gun shots, stabbings... just brutal injuries.
Trauma Center designation is a process outlined and developed at a state or local level. The state or local municipality identifies unique criteria in which to categorize Trauma Centers.
1 Both must have a adequately staffed OR that is immediately available, but in Level I this criterion is met by having a complete operating team in the hospital at all times, with individuals who are dedicated only to the operating room. 2  In-house CT technologist. 3  A surgically directed ICU physician team.
Normal ER visits are those that bring themselves in. Trauma patients are the ones coming in via 911 calls, ambulances, helicopters, etc. General rule of thumb-they are obvious exceptions as stabbings & gunshot wounds do happen outside of hospitals or the victims come wandering in.
There is certain criteria that must be met in order to be designated a Trauma Center,.for instance we have Trauma surgeons in the building 24/7, surgery staff 24/7, a certain number of ICU beds available, participate in research.....if you google Level I Trauma centers you'll get lots of info.
Level I. A Trauma Center classified as Level I provides the highest level of surgical care to trauma patients. A level I Trauma Center has a full arsenal of highly-trained specialists and equipment available at all times.
A trauma center is a hospital, or facility connected to a hospital, with the necessary medical equipment and resources to provide care for patients with severe injuries. In the United States, trauma centers may be classified into five different levels: Level I â V.
These facilities provide a wide range of high-level specialist care and act to supplement Level I centers. Generally, the biggest difference between Level I and II Trauma Centers is that Level II centers do not need to have ongoing research and education programs.
Designation Vs. Verification. Trauma center levels across the United States are identified in two fashions â A designation process and a verification process. The different levels (ie. Level I, II, III, IV or V) refer to the kinds of resources available in a trauma center and the number of patients admitted yearly.
Just for clarification: To the post that said traumas come in via EMS and ER pts. have to wait in the waiting room: Some ER patients are attended to instantly and arrive via EMS but do not qualify as traumas (trauma=some type of injury).

Itâs the reason nearly 70 percent of Americans and 40 percent of kids are overweight. In one study, Harvard scientists found that a high-sugar milkshake (compared to a low-sugar one) not only spiked blood sugar and insulin and led to sugar cravings, but it caused huge changes in the brain.

Many folks use honey because it tastes good, but also because this sweetener carries a healthier aura than table sugar. Ultimately though, your body breaks down honey just like table sugar, as glucose and fructose. Honey is still sugar, writes Dr. Jonny Bowden in his book The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth.
One 20-ounce soda has 15 teaspoons of sugar; Gatorade contains 14 teaspoons of the stuff in one bottle. One can of soda a day increases a kidâs chance of being obese by 60 percent and a womanâs chance of type 2 diabetes by 80 percent.
Thatâs why I created The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet. Early last year, I invited more than 600 people to try it out, and they lost more than 4,000 pounds in 10 days. But more important, they did it painlessly by enjoying powerful addiction-reversing foods that rewired and reset their brains and bodies.
Hi Meagan, Yes, the Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox diet is filled with nutritious whole foods including lean protein, vegetables, fruit, and healthy fats from nuts, seeds, olive oil, and coconut oil. The diet excludes foods that are common allergen and is safe for you and your baby while you are breastfeeding.
If sugar (by any name, including organic cane juice, honey, agave, maple syrup, cane syrup, or molasses) is on the label, throw it out , writes Dr. Mark Hyman. As a staple sweetener, you have far better options that don't raise blood sugar or stress your liver and can even provide some health benefits.

New Year's Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day, and Christmas Day are observed on the same calendar date each year. Holidays that fall on a Saturday are observed by federal employees who work a standard Monday to Friday week on the previous Friday.
Federal law (5 U.S.C. 6103) establishes the public holidays listed in these pages for Federal employees. Please note that most Federal employees work on a Monday through Friday schedule.
For these employees, when a holiday falls on a nonworkday -- Saturday or Sunday -- the holiday usually is observed on Monday (if the holiday falls on Sunday) or Friday (if the holiday falls on Saturday). To see holidays for a specific year, please select the tab labeled with your year of interest.

November 11 is also celebrated as Remembrance Day or Armistice Day in many parts of the world. Veterans Day is both a federal and state holiday and is usually observed on November 11 each year. In 1953 townspeople in Emporia, Kansas called the holiday Veteransâ Day in gratitude to the veterans in their town.
George Washington's Birthday became a Federal holiday in 1880. In 1888 and 1894, respectively, Decoration Day (now Memorial Day) and Labor Day were created. In 1938, Armistice Day (now Veterans Day) was created to mark the end of World War I.
Holidays designated by law to occur on Monday (i.e., Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Columbus Day) are moved to Sundays for employees at duty posts outside the United States who are regularly scheduled to work on Monday.

Honors all veterans of the United States armed forces. It is observed on November 11 to recall the end of World War I on that date in 1918 (major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 when the Armistice with Germany went into effect).
Employees under compressed work schedules are entitled to holiday premium pay if they are required to work during their basic work requirement on that day. The number of hours of holiday premium pay may not exceed the hours in an employee's compressed work schedule for that day (e.g., 8, 9, or 10 nonovertime hours).
An incision biopsy is where a cut is made and only a part or a piece of tissue is removed. An excision biopsy is where the whole swelling or lesion is removed fully. All heart surgeries are open heart surgery only, because heart is connected to an Heart lung Machine.
Biopsy (Definition) Biopsy is tissue removed by needle or cutting to remove part of a body part. It is usually a small amount of material that is processed by a pathologist. Most of the time it is stained and looked at through a microscope to arrive at a diagnosis. Special processes are done for some tissues or problems.
The lymphatic system is responsible for returning excess fluid from body tissues to the circulatory system and for defending against foreign or harmful agents such as bacteria, viruses, or cancerous cells. The major components of the lymphatic system are lymph capillaries, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph is a clear fluid found in tissues that originates from the circulatory system. Lymph capillaries are tiny vessels that carry excess lymph to larger lymph vessels; these in turn empty to the circulatory system.
Description of Lymph node excision. Lymph node excision: Surgical excision of one or more lymph nodes. Its most common use is in cancer surgery. (From Dorland, 28th ed, p966). Source: MeSH 2007.

For the best answers, search on this site https://shorturl.im/awSUd.  An incision is the cut made into the tissue to operate through.
First, an incision is made into the skin and through the subcutaneous layers in the area where the lymph nodes are to be removed. The lymph nodes are identified and isolated. They are then carefully taken out from surrounding tissues (that is, muscles, blood vessels, and nerves).

Biopsy with intent!: An excisional biopsy is a biopsy where the lesion is also excised or removed. When people here the word biopsy, they usually think that just a small sampling of the lesion will be obtained. However, there are times when its more appropriate to remove the whole lesion and send it to pathology.

While investigating a shooting, the officer moved, without probable cause, stereo equipment to record the serial numbers. The plain view doctrine has also been expanded to include the sub doctrines of plain feel, plain smell, and plain hearing.
The plain view doctrine is an exception to the warrant requirement which allows officers to seize items which they observe and immediately recognize as evidence or contraband while they are lawfully present in an area protected by the 4th Amendment.
It should be recognized that officers routinely make plain view observations, but that does not necessarily mean that the item may be seized unless the officer has met the elements above. A case from Ohio points out that lawful presence in an area protected by the 4th Amendment is essential to the plain view doctrine. In Ohio v. Cooper, police investigating a robbery developed Cooper as a suspect.
10. When an appellate court determines that the district court erred in upholding seizure of certain evidence upon which a search warrant's issuance was based in part, it must determine the validity of the warrant's issuance based upon the remaining, lawfully obtained, evidence.
For the plain view doctrine to apply for discoveries, the three-prong Horton test requires: 1  the officer to be lawfully present at the place where the evidence can be plainly viewed, 2  the officer to have a lawful right of access to the object, and. 3  the incriminating character of the object to be âimmediately apparent.â.
A number of courts have therefore used the term open view doctrine to refer to the rule that no Fourth Amendment search occurs where a law enforcement officer observes incriminating evidence or unlawful activity from a nonintrusive vantage point. See, e.g. , State v. Clark, 124 Idaho 308, 859 P.2d 344 (1993).
We are mindful of the Supreme Court's direction that a deficiency in either an informant's (1) veracity or reliability or (2) his or her basis of knowledge may be compensated for, in determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to the other, or by some other indicia of reliability.
The plain view doctrine allows an officer to seize â without a warrant â evidence and contraband found in plain view during a lawful observation. This doctrine is also regularly used by TSA Federal Government Officers while screening persons and property at U.S. airports.
Here Officer Jager was lawfully on the defendant's property for a knock and talk. As he was leaving the property by the way offered by the resident, the circle drive, he observed in plain view the contents of the trash bag, which were immediately known by the officer to contain evidence of a crime.
11. When reviewing a motion to suppress evidence, an appellate court reviews the factual underpinnings of a district court's decision by a substantial competent evidence standard and the ultimate legal conclusion drawn from those facts by a de novo standard. An appellate court will not reweigh the evidence.
Dimensions. A traveler who brings carry-on luggage onto a United flight must bring a bag that is less than 22 inches tall. The luggage also needs to be less than than 14 inches wide and 9 inches deep. Any luggage that you bring on a United flight must be able to fit under your seat or in an overhead bin.
Airwaysâhave settled on a uniform size (for now). Itâs 22 inches high x 9 inches deep x 14 inches wideâthese are external dimensions, including wheels and the handle. A few U.S. airlines are more generous with their carry-on size allowance, but some also impose weight restrictions and/or fees for carry-on baggage.
1 Walking canes or umbrellas. 2  Each passenger is permitted to bring one quart-sized bag of liquids aersols, gels, creams and pastes in your carryon bag and through the TSA security checkpoint. 3  These are limited to 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item.

Space Issues. Any luggage that you bring on a United flight must be able to fit under your seat or in an overhead bin. In some instances -- particularly if you are among the last to board a plane -- there might not be a lot of room left to store a bag in an overhead bin.
Sizing it up. When airlines refer to âcarry-on luggageâ or âcarry-on baggage,â they mean the bag that meets size specifications to store it in the overhead bin. Trouble is, there is no such thing as a standard carry-on size. Every U.S. airline has its own rules. The big threeâAmerican, Delta, and United/U.S.
1 Southwest Airlines limits carryon bag dimensions to 10 x 16 x 24 inches. 2  All Customers and Employees and their items are subject to a thorough, physical search. 3  The following items are not considered carryon bags or personal-type items and are not counted against the one-bag plus one personal-type item limit:
United Airlines has announced a new focus on ridding the overhead bins in its airplanes of oversized carry-on bags. (Published Tuesday, March 4, 2014).
American has staffers near security checkpoints in many of our largest airports to do visual checks on the size of carry-ons, Matt Miller, media relations manager with American Airlines, told NBC DFW in a statement Tuesday.
Weight. A lightweight, wheeled carry-on-size bag will be 7.5 pounds or less, experts say. Weight becomes particularly important on flights outside the United States, where carry-on weight is usually taken into account. Some U.S. airlines as well are beginning to impose weight restrictions on carry-on.
Zanesville Ohioâs First Y Bridge: 1814 â 1818. Zanesville, Ohio came into existence when Colonel Ebenezer Zane contracted with congress to build a road from Wheeling, West Virginia to Maysville, Kentucky. In return for this road known as Zaneâs Trace, Zane was to receive three 640 acre tracts of land.
March 13, 1963. The two diversion tunnels at Glen Canyon Dam are closed to allow Lake Powell to begin filling, which also led to the creation of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, a popular summer destination. Lake Powell is named after Major John Wesley Powell, who charted most of the area during two expeditions in 1869 and 1872.

Naming Ohio's Capital City. Ten years after the first constitutional convention named the state, the general assembly was called on to name the permanent capital city. Columbus is, I think, the only city in Ohio named by the Legislature. The history of the selection and christening of Ohio's capital is interesting.

Welcome to Powell County. Located at the foothills of the Eastern Appalachian Mountains, Powell County Kentucky is home to such scenic natural wonders as Red River Gorge, Natural Bridge and a host of other great outdoor adventures.
Powell, Ohio. Powell is an affluent city in Delaware County, Ohio, United States. The population was 11,500 at the 2010 census. The community was first settled around 1801, two years before Ohio became a state. It was named Middlebury at the time, because the first settlers came from the Middlebury, Connecticut area. In 1857, Judge Thomas Powell established the first post office in the community, and the residents decided to adopt his name.
Without further research it is impossible to know if the town is named after Christopher Columbus or the goddess Columbia. How the District of Columbia gots its name. On the first map of the city of Washington by federal city planner Pierre L'Enfant it was called the Permanent Seat of the Government.
Seventy million years of wind and water sculpting have created natural wonders and a vacationerâs paradise in the quaint Kentucky community of Powell County and its two towns of Clay City and Stanton.
Lake Powell was created in 1963 when the Glen Canyon Dam held back the waters of the Colorado River, forming a vast blue lake surrounded by beautiful sandstone walls.
To the ânormal personâ, pain is a mostly acute and infrequent sensation such as a headache, bruise, or the occasional back twinge. For some people however, pain can persist for months at a time, and is often completely unexplainable.
Placebo research has implicated prefrontal pathways in the brain as a source of cognitive pain modulation, because studies have consistently observed that activation of this area correlates with âemotional detachmentâ from the pain, and thus a higher ability to cope with it.
The process by which a noxious stimulus results in the conscious perception of pain is called nociception. This process has four elements: 1  Transduction: nociceptors detect potentially damaging (i.e. noxious) stimuli and convert them to electrical pain signals.
1 Second-order neurons transmit pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain stem, thalamus and other regions of the brain via the ascending pathway. 2  The descending pathway conveys pain modulating signals from the brain back down to the spinal cord.
The brain is in pain, physical and emotional pain has an effect on the brain. We will not have clear iron clad answers until we can understand how the brain thinks.
The multidimensionality of pain may be explained by the variety of sensory and cognitive aspects that may âtuneâ our individual pain thresholds. In anaesthetic research, much emphasis is now being placed on the emotional factors and thought processes that impact how we experience pain.
1 The resulting pain signal is transmitted by first-order neurons to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. 2  Second-order neurons transmit pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain stem, thalamus and other regions of the brain via the ascending pathway.
This imperative awareness is mediated by ânociceptiveâ nerve fibres that innervate our skin and organs, and feed into the pain processing pathways of the central nervous system. These fibres feed via the spinal cord to the brain stem, to the pain generating centres of the brain, most commonly the somatosensory cortex.
1 Nociceptors (pain nerve endings) are activated by painful stimuli. 2  The resulting pain signal is transmitted by first-order neurons to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. 3  Second-order neurons transmit pain signals from the spinal cord to the brain stem, thalamus and other regions of the brain via the ascending pathway.
1 Transmission: neurons transmit these signals to pain-processing structures of the spinal cord and brain. 2  Modulation: the signals can be amplified or dampened at various points in the pathway to facilitate or inhibit transmission, thereby enhancing or reducing the sensation of pain.
How to Make Beef Jerky Without a Dehydrator. Beef jerky can be made at home without needing any fancy equipment such as a dehydrator. With minimal adjustments a home oven can be used, which can actually dehydrate a greater amount of food at once than most store bought dehydrators. Any meat can be used to make jerky, but it makes sense to purchase an inexpensive cut since you won't need the tenderness of an expensive cut like a filet mignon.
This lets air circulate and dehydrate the food faster. If you have an oven circulation fan, this could be helpful as well but I have not used one before. It will take 2-6 hours to make the jerky depending on slice thickness and oven temperature. My batches are around 4 hours long.
To make beef jerky using the dehydrator, here is the step-by-step process to be followed: Remove the trays that come with the dehydrator and wash them with soap and water. Remember, the parts of the dehydrator with any electric parts should get wet. Dry off the trays.
Watch how to make this recipe. Trim the flank steak of any excess fat, place in a zip-top bag, and place it in the freezer for 1 to 2 hours in order to firm up. Remove the steak from the freezer and thinly slice the meat with the grain, into long strips. Place the strips of meat along with all of the remaining ingredients into a large, 1-gallon plastic zip-top bag and move around to evenly distribute all of the ingredients. Place the bag into the refrigerator for 3 to 6 hours. Remove the meat from the brine and pat dry. Evenly distribute the strips of meat onto 3 of the air filters, laying them in the grooves and then stacking the filters on top of one another. Top these with 1 empty filter.
The pre-heating stage takes around 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the dehydrator. While the dehydrator heats add the meat to the drying trays. The meat strips should be aligned in a single layer with spaces between them to allow good air flow. This may take six to 18 hours. There can also be a need to periodically rotate the trays for even cooking.
Dry the meat with paper towels. Then arrange the meat slices on the dehydratorâs drying racks, spacing each piece about 1/4 inch apart. Slide the racks into the dehydrator. Set the dehydrator to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Dehydrate the jerky until itâs cooked through and leathery, about four to five hours. Transfer the jerky from the dehydrator to a food-storage container. You can store the jerky at room temperature for one to two months if you add a silicon oxygen absorber to the container. Store jerky without an oxygen absorber at room temperature for one month.
Then cut each piece of meat into thin strips 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick. Most pieces will be 4 to 6 inches long, though some tidbits may be smaller. You can cut your strips either against the grain for the classic chewy jerky look and feel, or with the grain, which will produce a more sinewy texture.
Arrange the meat strips side-by-side across the racks, leaving at least 1/4-inch of space between strips. Place the racks of meat in the oven and cook until completely dry. This can take as little as 2 hours and as long as 5 hours, depending on the thickness and moistness of the meat, and how chewy you want it to be. The jerky will firm up as it cools.
When purchasing meats for jerky, choose lean meats with minimal marbling (fat), as fat tends to get rancid during storage. A lean cut of flank steak or round steak makes excellent jerky. Most lean meats will yield about 1 pound of jerky for 3 pounds of meat. Jerky may be made from a variety of meats including wild game meats, fish and poultry. Use filets of fish and breast of chicken.
When you are jerking game meats, freeze meats for at least 60 days at 0Â°F (-18Â°C) before drying as a precaution against any diseases the animal might be carrying. Then thaw meat, add seasoning and press into strips or sticks, and place on trays to dry. Depending on how thick meat is cut, how heavily dryer is loaded, and the humidity, jerky takes from 4 to 15 hours to dry.

Powder coating is a type of coating that is applied as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main difference between a conventional liquid paint and a powder coating is that the powder coating does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. (Powder Coatings) Any coating which is applied to the surface as a dry, finely ground powder and then heated above its melting point so that the powder particles flow together to form a film.
A virtual interface is a pointer to an actual interface in SystemVerilog. It is most often used in classes to provide a connection point to allow classes to access the signals in the interface through the virtual interface pointer. You can see some examples of how to use virtual interfaces in the UVM Cookbook.
Desktop virtualization can be used in conjunction with application virtualization and user profile management systems, now termed user virtualization, to provide a comprehensive desktop environment management system.
Configuring Virtual Interfaces. Virtual interfaces are software-based interfaces that you create in the memory of the networking device using Cisco IOS commands. Virtual interfaces do not have a hardware component such as the RJ-45 female port on a 100BASE-T Fast Ethernet network interface card.
1. Re: Difference between logical interface and virtual interface Scott Morris - CCDE/4xCCIE/2xJNCIE Sep 16, 2009 10:03 AM (in response to rjallipa) That's kind of a tough one... So let's take a stab at this here. First... Anything that does not have a physical presence is technically a logical interface.
Virtual interfaces are network interfaces that are not associated with a physical interface. Physical interfaces have some form of physical elementâfor example, an RJ-45 male connector on an Ethernet cable. Virtual interfaces exist only in software; there are no physical elements.
Temporary virtual network interface. The process of creating a virtual network interface in Linux is a quite simple matter. It involves a single execution of the ifconfig command. ifconfig eth0:0 123.123.22.22. The above command will create a new virtual network interface based on original eth0 physical interface.
virtual interfaces come into play when using classes to defer at a later stage the definition of the physical interface to the one being worked on in the class. The other advantage is that a class can be instanced multiple times and connect to different physical interfaces.
Did you know that you can assign more that one IP address to a single physical network interface? This technique is quite useful, for example when working with Apache and virtual hosts, as it allows you to access same Apache server by using two different IP addresses. Temporary virtual network interface. The process of creating a virtual network interface in Linux is a quite simple matter. It involves a single execution of the ifconfig command. The above command will create a new virtual network interface based on original eth0 physical interface.
The IP traffic will be flowing through the virtual interface (which is in turn tied to the subinterface (logical), which is in turn tied to the physical frame-relay interface. Kinda fun when you start piling things on that way. HTH, Scott.
Desktop virtualization. Desktop virtualization is software technology that separates the desktop environment and associated application software from the physical client device that is used to access it.
Trichomoniasis (trick-o-mon-I-AS-is), also known as trich (trick), is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. Call (866) 660-2593 and speak to one of our Care Advisors for more information.
What is the treatment for trichomoniasis? Trichomoniasis can be cured with a single dose of prescription antibiotic medication (either metronidazole or tinidazole), pills which can be taken by mouth. It is okay for pregnant women to take this medication. Some people who drink alcohol within 24 hours after taking this kind of antibiotic can have uncomfortable side effects.
About Trichomoniasis. Trichomoniasis (or trich) is a very common sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is caused by infection with a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. Although symptoms of the disease vary, most women and men who have the parasite cannot tell they are infected. Trichomoniasis is considered the most common curable STD.
Trichomonas vaginalis is a microscopic parasite found worldwide. Infection with Trichomonas is called trichomoniasis (trick-oh-moe-nye-uh-sis). Trichomoniasis is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), mainly affecting sexually active women.
Trichomoniasis (trich) is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. About 70% of women and men do not have symptoms when infected. When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure.
Thatâs because trichomoniasis mainly causes what Delgado calls ânuisance symptoms.â So rather than the serious pain or sores that might come with other STDs, you may experience annoying vaginal itching, burning, or discharge.
One, many people who contract the STD, which occurs when the parasite trichomonas vaginalis is exchanged through intercourse, wonât have any symptoms, says Celyna Delgado, M.D., an ob-gyn at the Institute for Womenâs Health in San Antonio.
About 70% of infected people do not show any signs or symptoms. When trichomoniasis does cause symptoms, they can range from mild irritation to severe inflammation. Some people with symptoms present them within 5 to 28 days after being infected, but others do not develop symptoms until much later.
Trichomoniasis among pregnant women also increases the risk of delivering a preterm baby, finds an analysis of 11 studies published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Luckily, the STD can be treated with an antibiotic. Usually, all it takes is a single dose of Flagyl, says Delgado.
Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) which is most often spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can also spread through genital touching. People who are infected may spread the disease even when symptoms are not present.
Franchise Tax. The Texas franchise tax is a privilege tax imposed on each taxable entity formed or organized in Texas or doing business in Texas. For more information, see the Franchise Tax Overview.
Franchise tax. A franchise tax is a government levy (tax) charged by some US states to certain business organizations such as corporations and partnerships with a nexus in the state. A franchise tax is not based on income. Rather, the typical franchise tax calculation is based on the net worth of or capital held by the entity.
With the exception of sole proprietorship businesses, just about all types of companies doing business in Texas must pay a franchise tax. Franchise taxes fall under the privilege tax category. Privilege taxes are assessed on businesses that are headquartered outside of Texas and conduct business within the state.
No member of the secretary of state staff can determine whether an entity is transacting business in Texas or needs to file an application for registration. Determining whether to register is a business decision that may have tax consequences, raise legal issues, or impact licensing from another agency or state board.

The United States-based Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) (a non-governmental organization) maintains an International Directory which contains contact information about 467 quality assurance bodies, accreditation bodies and Ministries of Education in 175 countries.
The United States Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation recognize the Commission as the assigned regional accrediting organization. HLC grew out of the higher education division of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA). The NCA dissolved in 2014.
Ultimately, the âgold standardâ of all higher education accreditation standards is called REGIONAL accreditation. This is the mandatory accreditation required by most reputable employers, companies, graduate schools, transfer institutions, and beyond.
The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) is an organization tasked with the regional accreditation responsibilities for post-secondary education institutions in the central United States.
From pharmacy studies, to nursing schools â and even funeral service programs â there are recognized accreditation agencies for nearly any type of higher education you are interested in pursuing. Now, it is VERY important to note that recognition is NOT endorsement and does not imply/guarantee any level of quality.
The concept of accreditation is simple: Anytime a government, or 3rd-party organization (usually a non-profit organization) offers certification of competency, authority, or credibility, it can be considered a form of accreditation.
There are six regional accreditors involved in higher education accreditation in the United States. 1  Middle States Commission on Higher Education. 2  New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC-CIHE) Commission on Institutions of Higher Education. (NEASC-CTCI) Commission on Technical and Career Institutions.
Assuring broad student access through America's diverse higher education system is difficult for the federal government because each of the 50 states has a unique mix of tuition, institutional support, and state-supported financial aid working in conjunction with federal activities.
By David A. Longanecker. Executive Director, Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education. Although the federal government plays a secondary role in supporting and financing American higher education, this role remains quite substantial and clearly helps shape the enterprise.
The Higher Learning Commission oversees the accreditation of degree-granting colleges and universities in nineteen mostly Midwestern and South-Central states, namely Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Mexico, South Dakota, Wisconsin, West Virginia, ...

The susceptible method to finding the brightest spot in an image is to use the cv2.minMaxLoc function without any pre-processing. This function requires a single argument, which is our grayscale image.
This reader wanted to know the best way to find the optic nerve center, which is normally the brightest spot of the retinal image. To find the brightest spot of the image using Python and OpenCV, you would utilize the cv2.minMaxLoc function. However, the term âspotâ here is a little misleading. The âbrightest spotâ of the image according to cv2.minMaxLoc actually isnât a region â itâs simply the brightest single pixel in the entire image.
Then create a Mat object that will store the data of the loaded image. Now we call the function which loads the image name specified by the first argument (argv[1]). The second argument specifies the format in what we want the image. This may be: 1  CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE (0) loads the image as an intensity one.
The first switch, --image, is the path to the image we are going to find the brightest spot in. The second switch --radius, is an integer indicating the radius of the Gaussian blur we are going to apply to the image. Itâs important to note that this radius value must be odd and not even.
If the second argument is not specified by the user, it is implied to be. , which means you canât change the size of the image. Finally, to update the content of the OpenCV window with a new image use the function.

The 58-page memorandum is among the most influential documents composed by the U.S. Government during the Cold War, and was not declassified until 1975. Its authors argued that one of the most pressing threats confronting the United States was the âhostile designâ of the Soviet Union.
Building upon the conclusions of an earlier National Security Council paper (NSC-20/4), the authors of NSC-68 based their conclusions on the theory that the decline of the Western European powers and Japan following World War II had left the United States and the Soviet Union as the two dominant powers.
The Soviet Union had the world's longest border, like Russia, measuring over 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi), or 1 1/2 circumferences of Earth. Two-thirds of it were a coastline. Across the Bering Strait was the United States.
Reeling from the recent victory of Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War and the successful detonation of an atomic weapon by the Soviet Union, Secretary of State Dean Acheson asked the Policy Planning Staff, led by Paul Nitze, to undertake a comprehensive review of U.S. national security strategy.
On 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The Space Race heated up, and the USSR took an early lead with the first ever satellite and world's first human spaceflight. In the 1970s, there was, briefly, a detente dÃ©tente of relations with The United, states but tensions resumed when The Soviet union deployed troops In afghanistan in. 1979 the war drained economic resources and was matched by an escalation Of american military. strength
The authors of NSC-68 rejected a renewal of U.S. isolationism, fearing that this would lead to the Soviet domination of Eurasia, and leave the United States marooned on the Western Hemisphere, cut off from the allies and resources it needed to fend off further Soviet encroachments.
Critics such as Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, and senior diplomats such as Soviet experts and former ambassadors to the Soviet Union George Kennan and Charles Bohlen, argued that the United States already had a substantial military advantage over the Soviet Union.
In 1922, the Communists were victorious, forming the Soviet Union with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924, a troika and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s.
The role of science education can basically be explained by the four main purposes of science education. These main purposes state that science education should: a. > Provide learners with a basis for understanding and coping with their lives. b. > Provide learners with the opportunity to learn about science. c.
To give an overview of the basis of a classical upper mathematics curriculum, the curriculum should be interested in the structure of mathematical concepts in the abstract, and provide the opportunity to begin to see how these concepts provide insight into how we see the world around us.
Science today isn't the same as the science 2000 years ago was but some principles remain the same. The human knowledge constantly grows but with more knowledge there comes even more mysteries and unsolved questions, so science is always going forward.
What is the main purpose of science? The main purpose of science is to expand the human knowledge. Science is all about logic and rational as compared to religion which is mostly based on belief, and where logic and rationality play smaller roles.
When considering classical mathematics, the Greeks must be a main focus of our attention. In fact, the primary reason for discussing earlier mathematics is to understand what the Greeks inherited and what they left to their posterity.

Mathematics is any one of these or some combination, depending on the context. The purpose of this article is to address how mathematics should be viewed to obtain a clearer picture of the ultimate aim of its study in a classical education. This discussion will primarily involve upper mathematics, or the mathematics typically seen in the eighth through twelfth grades.
Monday, March 21, 2011. The main purpose of science is to expand the human knowledge. Science is all about logic and rational as compared to religion which is mostly based on belief, and where logic and rationality play smaller roles.
In some cases, it is very difficult to determine the boundaries of science, or to put it in other words how much is science allowed to go, and what is considered unethical (for instance the question of cloning people).
When surveying the landscape of classical education, it becomes evident that there is a clear vision available for the purpose of the study of humanities. What does not seem as clear, though, is the nature of mathematics in a classical education.
Because some of these substances can be detected in body samples such as blood, urine, and tissue, these markers may be used, along with other tests and procedures, to help detect and diagnose some types of cancer, predict and monitor a person's response to certain treatments, and detect recurrence.
The SCENAR device then interprets the brainâs response and modifies its next impulse back to the brain to work at restoring balance to the body (This is called active reflex biofeedback) The brain, in turn, sends a modified response (and so on) until equilibrium is achieved (homeostasis).

Nearly every patient in the NHS has had dealings with pathology services at some point. Every time you give a blood, stool, urine or tissue sample, it is analysed by a pathologist or pathology scientist known as a biomedical or clinical scientist, depending on their skills and qualifications.
Some tumor markers are specific for a particular type of cancer, while others are seen in several different types of cancer. Not every person with a particular type of cancer will have an elevated level of the corresponding tumor marker. Not every cancer has a tumor marker that has been identified as associated with it.
How Does Scenar Work? The SCENAR device works through your skin (transdermal). It uses computer-modulated, electrical impulses to stimulate your brain (electroneuro-stimulator). The brain responds with itâs own signal which is picked up by the SCENAR device.
What is pathology? Unlike the pathologists you might see on the television, those working in the NHS are more likely to work for the benefit of the living, rather than spending all day with dead bodies performing post-mortems or investigating murders. Pathology is the study of disease, its causes and progression.

Virginia is cited by deposit opponents as an excellent example of a successful litter tax program. But close examination reveals that these figures are based on surveys of just 1.8 miles of Virginia roadway.
The stateâs consumer use tax is the âother halfâ of the Virginia retail sales and use tax requirements. Typically, residents incur the use tax when they purchase more than $100 worth of items in a tax year, upon which they did not pay sales tax.
The failure of California's litter tax was widely regarded as a waste of' government resources. According to the legislative analyst's office, the program was inefficient and probably ineffective. Funding was reduced to zero in 1981, and the state repealed the law in 1982. Kentucky. Kentucky's litter tax took effect in June of 1978.
Virginiaâs tax rates range from 2% to 5.75% and are assessed over 4 income tax brackets. More on Virginia taxes can be found in the tabbed pages below.
Litter taxes do not provide a disincentive to litter. Since they are passed on to consumers in the price of goods, citizens don't know they are paying or why. Most litter taxes are collected three times: once from the manufacturer, again from the wholesaler, and once from the retailer.
Beverage companies offer up litter taxes as a magic elixir to all our litter problems. Litter taxes generate funds to educate the public not to litter. They implement a bureaucracy to oversee litter education and sometimes provide funds for litter cleanup.
Sales taxes. Virginiaâs state sales and use tax rate is 4.3%. There is an additional 1% local tax, for a total of a 5.3% combined sales tax on most Virginia purchases. There is an additional 0.7% state tax imposed in the localities that make up Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, making the rate in these areas 6%.
An annual litter tax is imposed on all Virginia businesses that were in operation on Jan. 1 of the tax year. The tax is $10 per year for each location of manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors or retailers of consumer products and an additional $15 per year per location where groceries, soft drinks and beer are sold.
Tennessee citizens have been paying litter taxes on beer and soft drinks since 1981 (50 cents per barrel of beer and a percentage of the gross-receipts tax on soft drinks)âthe industry-brokered result of TN's first effort to pass a bottle bill.
The taxes currently raise $5.1 million for the county litter grants program under TDOT's Beautification Office. Most of this funds litter pickup by county jail inmates (they get two days off their sentence for each day spent picking up litter). The rest goes to litter education or to Keep Tennessee Beautiful.

A blue Jelly Fish. Jelly Fish, also known as Swedish Fish in parts of the game, is a special candy in Candy Crush Saga that used to appear only in jelly levels, but after level 1247, it can appear in any level type. (However, the booster version cannot be selected before the start of the level except in jelly levels and mixed levels).
(Malaco is now owned by the Cloetta company, which also makes Fazer chocolates.) Theyâre actually quite different from the North American variety. They do come in four flavors: lemon, orange, pear and berry. They are also a winegum-style of jelly candy, not a gummi.
Malaco Pastellfiskar (Swedish Fish) A favorite candy in the United States are the Swedish Fish. Today theyâre made by Cadbury Adams in Canada. Though they come in multiple flavors, the favorite is the red lingonberry flavored fish with the word Swedish embossed on the side.
Swedish Fish. In 1958, Malaco, a Swedish confectionery manufacturer, decided to expand its business by exporting a few of their products to North America. Allsorts Licorice, Ribbons and Licorice Laces candy were the first products to be exported to North America. [continued below] Results: 1 â 12 of 12.

Novelty: 7. Overall: 7. The Swedish Fish, as the name implies originated in Sweden by the Malaco candy company. In 1958 the Malaco company began exporting some of their candy goods to North America starting with licorices.
Swedish Fish Candy. Swedish Fish are a chewy candy in a fish shaped that were developed by the Swedish. Today the Swedish Fish consumed in North America are made in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, by MondelÄz International. In Canada, Swedish Fish are distributed under Cadbury's Maynards brand. Swedish Fish come in two different sizes: regular and mini.
The fish-shaped candiesâcalled Swedish Fish because, well, they were Swedish and the fishing industry in Sweden was very largeâwere developed specifically for the US and Canadian markets and proved almost immediately popular. Swedish Fish then became firmly entrenched in US candy culture in the 1960s and Ë70s.
In the BeginningÂ¦. Out of the primordial ooze of the sugar sea, from whence the flora and fauna of the gummy earth have evolved, come the Swedish Fish. The Swedish Fish belongs to the genus of wine gums, a firmer version of gummy candy that, rather disappointingly, contains no wine, but is still extremely popular in Europe.
Are Swedish fish from Sweden? Answer Wiki. I didn't know what Swedish fish was, until I visited New York City. Yes, they are originally Swedish, but the ones sold in the US are produced in Canada. The ones we have here in Sweden are not called Swedish fish, they are not called anything in particular, just random candy. In Sweden we buy candy for $5 per pound by filling a bag with the stuff we want from a large selection, and Swedish fish is just one of many.

In a fixed hernia, part of your stomach pushes through your diaphragm and stays there. Most cases are not serious. However, there is a risk that blood flow to your stomach could become blocked. If that happens, it could cause serious damage and is considered a medical emergency.
1 A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm and into your chest region. 2  There are generally two types of hiatal hernia: sliding and fixed.  This condition mostly occurs in people who are over 50 years old.
1 Inguinal, in the groin. This is the the most common type. 2  Umbilical, around the belly button. 3  Incisional, through a scar. 4  Hiatal, a small opening in the diaphragm that allows the upper part of the stomach to move up into the chest.  Congenital diaphragmatic, a birth defect that needs surgery.
A hernia happens when part of an internal organ or tissue bulges through a weak area of muscle. Most hernias are in the abdomen. There are several types of hernias, including. Inguinal, in the groin. This is the the most common type.
A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm and into your chest region. The diaphragm is a large muscle that lies between your abdomen and chest. You use this muscle to help you breathe. Normally, your stomach is below the diaphragm, but in people with a hiatal hernia, a portion of the stomach pushes up through the muscle. The opening it moves through is called a hiatus. This condition mostly occurs in people who are over 50 years old.
A femoral hernia occurs when the intestine enters the canal carrying the femoral artery into the upper thigh. Femoral hernias are most common in women, especially those who are pregnant or obese. In an umbilical hernia, part of the small intestine passes through the abdominal wall near the navel.
A hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weak spot in a surrounding muscle or connective tissue called fascia. The most common types of hernia are inguinal (inner groin), incisional (resulting from an incision), femoral (outer groin), umbilical (belly button), and hiatal (upper stomach). In an inguinal hernia, the intestine or the bladder protrudes through the abdominal wall or into the inguinal canal in the groin. About 96% of all groin hernias are inguinal, and most occur in men because of a natural weakness in this area. In an incisional hernia, the intestine pushes through the abdominal wall at the site of previous abdominal surgery.
A hiatal hernia occurs when part of your stomach pushes upward through your diaphragm. Your diaphragm normally has a small opening (hiatus) through which your food tube (esophagus) passes on its way to connect to your stomach. The stomach can push up through this opening and cause a hiatal hernia. In most cases, a small hiatal hernia doesn't cause problems, and you may never know you have a hiatal hernia unless your doctor discovers it when checking for another condition. But a large hiatal hernia can allow food and acid to back up into your esophagus, leading to heartburn. Self-care measures or medications can usually relieve these symptoms, although a very large hiatal hernia sometimes requires surgery.
Hernias are common. They can affect men, women, and children. A combination of muscle weakness and straining, such as with heavy lifting, might contribute. Some people are born with weak abdominal muscles and may be more likely to get a hernia. Treatment is usually surgery to repair the opening in the muscle wall. Untreated hernias can cause pain and health problems.
The signs and symptoms of a hernia can range from noticing a painless lump to the severely painful, tender, swollen protrusion of tissue that you are unable to push back into the abdomen (an incarcerated strangulated hernia). Abdominal or pelvic pain can be part of the symptoms of many hernias. Reducible hernia.

There are about 2,500 BTU in one cubic foot of propane and only about 1,000 BTU in one cubic foot of natural gas. Manufacturers tout the number of BTU their grills can produce, but the number can be very misleading. BTU is not indicative of the heat it can generate.

The chief advantages of gas over charcoal is that there is no dirty charcoal to handle, no ash to clean up, they can get up to max heat faster than charcoal, and you have temperature control just by turning a knob. Modern gas grills seem to have more bells and whistles to choose from than digital cameras.
A good gas grill must have a minimum of two burners. This is a must for 2-zone cooking, the most important technique you need to learn for successful outdoor cooking. The more burners, the better. Some burners line up side to side and others line up front to back.

A topic that is not widely discussed but that is becoming more common. Breastfeeding is a journey. For some itâs smooth and for some itâs bumpy and windy. Our journey has been the latter. Today Iâm sharing what Iâve learned and wish I had known sooner about Tongue Tied and Lip Tied Babies.
Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is a condition present at birth that restricts the tongue's range of motion. With tongue-tie, an unusually short, thick or tight band of tissue (lingual frenulum) tethers the bottom of the tongue's tip to the floor of the mouth. A person who has tongue-tie might have difficulty sticking out his or her tongue.
My baby girl is nine months old today! Our breastfeeding relationship got off to a rough start because of an undiagnosed posterior tongue tie and lip tie. The pediatrician in the hospital did not diagnose her, neither did our LC nor family doctor.
Tongue and/or lip ties are also associated with reflux, which can cause significant pain for baby and may result in the need for medication. Any of the following symptoms in parent or baby may indicate that tongue-tie is affecting breastfeeding. Signs in parent: â¢nipple pain and/or erosions.
Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia) is where the strip of skin connecting the baby's tongue to the floor of their mouth is shorter than usual. Some babies who have tongue-tie don't seem to be bothered by it. In others, it can restrict the tongue's movement, making it harder to breastfeed. Tongue-tie is sometimes diagnosed during a baby's routine newborn check, but it's not always easy to spot. It may not become apparent until your baby has problems feeding.
Tongue and lip-tie are common causes of nipple pain, uneven breast drainage, slow weight gain and low milk supply. Many physicians do not properly assess for tongue or lip-tie or recognize their impact on the breastfeeding relationship, leaving babies vulnerable to early weaning.
Here are some warning signs that we have seen that can be linked to lip tie: 1  Her upper lip is tucked in while nursing not flanged out. 2  Poor latch. 3  Upper lip blister caused by poor latch. 4  Colic. Gassy Baby.  Pain/discomfort while 1  nursing. Baby has poor sleep and is hard to settle.
Also, many lip tied babies will also be tongue tied, the two are often found together. I have had a hard time checking Girly Q, she hates when I poke around in her mouth and especially under her tongue but from what we have seen we think that she may have one.
I am not saying each baby with latch issues is tongue or lip tied, (and not every baby with a lip and/or tongue tie has trouble breastfeeding) but if you are having problems, and seem to have no answers - research it and see if tongue tie (especially POSTERIOR tongue tie) and/or lip tie is the issue.

The first Web site built was at CERN and was first put online on 6 August 1991 by Timothy John Berners-Lee.The first website was info.cern.ch. It was an internal page used at CERN, where Tim Berners Lee invented HTML. By the way, the Internet was created long before the 90's, it first appeared in 1969 as a DARPA project. The Web came in the 90's.
Best Answer: The first Web site built was at CERN and was first put online on 6 August 1991 by Timothy John Berners-Lee.The first website was info.cern.ch Source(s): melissa b Â· 1 decade ago
What was the first website Ever? I always wondered this i know the internet was created by teh US military in the 90's as a means communication but i wanted to know, What was the FIRST actual web page. EG: google.com Follow
Snapshots of the original website were preserved, but not the site itself at its original URL, until now. Although the NeXT machineâthe original web serverâis still at CERN, sadly the world's first website is no longer online at its original address, CERN wrote.
To commemorate that occasion, the very first website is now back online at its original URL. Physicist Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web in 1989 at CERN, the European nuclear research and particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. CERN didn't try to keep the technology to itself.
Berners-Lee hosted the first website on a computer built by NeXT, the company Steve Jobs founded when he was exiled from Apple. That very first Web server does still exist, and it recently got a tune-up.
Of the thousands of websites founded prior to 1995, those appearing here are listed for one or more of the following reasons: 1  They still exist (albeit in some cases with different names). 2  They made contributions to the history of the world wide web. 3  They helped to shape certain modern Web content, such as webcomics and weblogs.
World Wide Web The WorldWideWeb (W3) is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents. Everything there is online about W3 is linked directly or indirectly to this document, including an executive summary of the project, Mailing lists, Policy, November's W3 news, Frequently Asked Questions.
CERN's restoration project will go beyond simply preserving the website. For a start we would like to restore the first URLâput back the files that were there at their earliest possible iterations, the first website project site notes. Then we will look at the first web servers at CERN and see what assets from them we can preserve and share.
Oh how I love succulents! And, a succulent with lots of long lasting flowers is just the catâs meow. Enter the popular Kalanchoe blossfeldiana which is most commonly sold as a houseplant but here in Santa Barbara (USDA zone 10) mine enjoy the great outdoors year round. Hereâs how to take care of Kalanchoes, or Kals as we used to call them, both in the house and in the garden.
The one in this post is Kalanchoe blossfeldiana which is the popular flowering kalanchoe sold in the houseplant trade. There are hundreds of species of kalanchoes. I like this one because of the show of flowers it puts out & the colors it comes in â vibrant.
Mother-of-thousands plant (Kalanchoe daigremontiana) is hardy in USDA zones 9 through 11. This kalanchoe rarely blooms when grown as a houseplant, and the flowers are barely noticeable. Plants typically die after flowering and may be replaced by potting up the tiny plantlets that form along leaf edges.
Kalanchoe is a dark green, succulent perennial with scallop-edged leaves and large umbels of flower clusters held above the foliage (Fig. 1). The upright, many-branched growth habit and tolerance of low moisture conditions makes it ideal for groundcover use, rock gardens, raised planters, or containers.
Flapjack plant (Kalanchoe thyrsiflora) is hardy in USDA zones 9 through 11 and also may be grown as a houseplant. Its paddle-shaped leaves typically reach 6 inches in diameter and grow on the plant stems in a way that resembles a stack of flapjacks.
Kalanchoe Care: As A Houseplant & In The Garden Kalanchoes, with their vibrant long lasting flowers, are great in the garden or as houseplants. Check out these tips on how to care for them in pots as well as how to repot them.
The common houseplant kalanchoe (Kalanchoe blossfeldiana) is a perennial hardy in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10 through 11. It may be grown as an annual or houseplant in cooler zones and blooms 9 to 12 months after planting, reaching 6 to 12 inches tall.
This one is the rosebud or double Kalanchoe. Tip: Yes, that paper wrapping may be prettier than the grow pot but remove it when you water your plant. Remember, the Kalanchoe is a succulent & too much water building up will drown it out. Now, onward to caring for them as a houseplants.
The name kalanchoe refers to a large group of highly varied plants. Some kalanchoes produce colorful, eye-catching blooms; some rarely flower at all. Some feature fuzzy leaves while others feature smooth leaves. Sizes range from tiny sub-shrubs less than 12 inches tall to tree-sized plants.
Kalanchoe luciae can be told apart by having large, flat and often red-tinged leaves (that look like paddles) while Kalanchoe thyrsiflora is a sea-green plant with smaller, slightly cupped leaves that rarely show any red or pink coloration.
After six days of such testimony, the jury unanimously recommended the death penalty. The Esperanza Fire started on October 26, 2006, in the San Jacinto Mountains above the Banning Pass; it burned 41,000 acres and destroyed dozens of homes.

John Maclean, award-winning author of three previous books on wildfire disasters, has written another, a book on the Esperanza Fire; it's been published by Counterpoint Press of Berkeley, California.
Maclean first visited the site of the Esperanza Fire in 2007, the spring after it occurred, and he has returned many times since. He covered the lengthy Oyler trial in Riverside, California, and he details both the trial and the fire in his new book, The Esperanza Fire: Arson, Murder, and the Agony of Engine 57.
The Esperanza Fire is available on Amazon.com or directly from the author. When a jury returns to a packed courtroom to announce its verdict in a capital murder case, every noise -- even a scraped chair or an opening door -- resonates like a high-tension cable snap.
The Esperanza Fire started on Oct. 26, 2006, in Cabazon, Calif., about two hours north of San Diego. Driven by Santa Ana winds, it burned 41,000 acres and destroyed 34 homes. An investigation later determined that the fire was set by an arsonist, and in 2009 Raymond Lee Oyler was sentenced to death for the crime.
A couple months ago, as I made one of my many visits to San Diego to prepare for Firehouse World 2016, I had the unique opportunity to visit the site of the Esperanza Fire, a wind-driven wildland/urban interface (WUI) fire that occurred in 2006.
But it was also eye-opening. The lessons of the Esperanza Fire have a direct application to structural firefightingâand not only because, as the WUI expands, the lines between âwildland firefighterâ and âstructural firefighterâ are beginning to blur.
The Esperanza Fire was reported on October 26, 2006 at 1:11 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. (PDT) in Cabazon, California, within the jurisdiction of the California Department of. Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE).

A feminist, in her view, is any woman who deems to be powerful, a definition, that would include Margaret Thatcher, Sandra Day O'Connor, Mother Teresa and even âFeminists for Lifeâ (a group she believes should be welcomed at campus women's centers.)
That is why so many feminist (and anti-feminist) groups exist; no one size fits all. At the same time, I suppose it depends. There are certainly white, upper-class, educated women who have been raped or discriminated against, and perhaps they believe in power feminism.
Girl power's commercial success has rendered it incapable of meeting one of Wolf's key standards for power feminism: It does not demand structural change.''^ I argue that because power feminism embraces and celebrates commercialism, the path from feminist discourse to empty signifier has been a slippery slope.
When the feminist movement rebounded, it became focused on a single issue, woman suffrage, a goal that would dominate international feminism for almost 70 years. After the U.S. Civil War, American feminists assumed that woman suffrage would be included in the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibited disfranchisement on the basis of race.

9) Feminist views of power. The feminist view of power is relatively simple; they believe that power in society is unequally, and unjustly, balanced towards men. Feminists say this leads to the discrimination of women, with men using their power to control womenâs lives. Many feminists separate the power men have over women into two âspheresâ, the public and theâ¦

Holy cow, you should see the sodium content on some when what should be a tsp gets entered as a Tbsp! Some people do know the difference between a TBSP and a tsp, but may not do the math properly. It's probably best to enter the TBS data, but change the serving size to .33 since 3 tsps = 1 Tbsp, then the tracker will do the math for you.

Trump will be impeached or resign, Moore argues. 1.9k. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, who in July correctly predicted Donald Trump would win the White House, now says the president-electâs first term will end in either his resignation or impeachment.
Before Trump took office, critics believed that he would be impeached on the very first day if he did not agree to place his assets in the blind trust. Well, here we are a couple of weeks later, and nearly everyone has accepted the blatant violation by Donald Trump. The onus to impeach Trump lies completely on Congress.
He will break laws because heâs only thinking about whatâs best for him.. Trump will be impeached or resign, Moore argues. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, who in July correctly predicted Donald Trump would win the White House, now says the president-electâs first term will end in either his resignation or impeachment.
As for during his presidency if it does occur: Donald Trump will likely be a very weak president for a host of reasons. He has limited support from his own party and the Democrats will do everything that they can to obstruct him for his entire term in office.
Normally, I would say that a Republican President would not face any real risk of impeachment from a Republican House of Representatives; the decision to impeach the President (which has only happened twice) is almost entirely partisan. However, Trump isnât a very normal example of a Republican. It is possible that the Republican House will decide that they like the idea of President Mike Pence enough to find some pretext to impeach President Trump.
Itâs notable that Nixon, a Republican, faced impeachment in a Congress controlled by Democrats, and Clinton was impeached by a Republican-controlled Congress. For Trump to be impeached, members of his own party would have to turn on him. Thatâs why Republican base approval of Trump is so important.
Only two presidents in history have been impeached, but murmurs continue to surround Trump. Hereâs how the process would work â if it would at all. Tom McCarthy in New York. Wednesday 22 March 2017 03.30 EDT First published on Wednesday 22 March 2017 02.00 EDT.
Both an impeachment in the U.S. House of Representatives and a trial in the Senate will require public evidence. The case made above relies on readily available and public evidence in great abundance that will grow daily, and may very well come to include benefits from the Russian government.
Another option that can lead to the impeachment of Donald Trump is the 25th amendment of the constitution. Under the Amendment, Vice President can assume the role of acting President. This is also an unlikely scenario and might never lead to Trumpâs impeachment.
This restriction is absolute and cannot be waived by Congress. Trump is already in violation of it and will be more so with every law, rule, regulation, enforcement, or lack thereof that his subordinates, Congress, or any agency of the federal government enacts to the benefit of Trumpâs businesses and possessions.

As with other blackface material, performances of Dixie were accompanied by dancing. The song is a walkaround, which originally began with a few minstrels acting out the lyrics, only to be joined by the rest of the company (a dozen or so individuals for the Bryants).
Re: The meaning of a phrase. Posted by ESC on September 10, 2003. In Reply to: Re: The meaning of a phrase posted by Henry on September 10, 2003. : : Hi, I am actually looking for two things:
Dixie, also known as Dixie's Land, I Wish I Was in Dixie, and other titles, is a popular American song. It is one of the most distinctively American musical products of the 19th century, and probably the best-known song to have come out of blackface minstrelsy. Although not a folk song at its creation, Dixie has since entered the American folk vernacular.
The song likely cemented the word Dixie in the American vocabulary as a toponym for the Southern United States. Although most sources credit Ohio-born Daniel Decatur Emmett with the song's composition, other people have claimed to have composed Dixie, even during Emmett's lifetime.
You are right. Tom: Sure is hot today. Bill: Yeah, you ain't just whistlin' Dixie. It's a scorcher. Charlie: That was a good movie. Jane: You ain't just whistlin' Dixie. It was the best I've ever seen.

Photo by Gabriela Lambert. Taylor Goldsmith's life revolves entirely around music. His band, Dawes, has been on a small tour of independent record stores around the country, playing in-stores as part of a promotion for their highly anticipated third album, Stories Don't End.
This summer, California folk-rock outfit Dawes lapped the country with Bob Dylan, playing a total of 21 shows together.
In December 2013, the song Just Beneath the Surface from Stories Don't End was featured in the episode Independent Movie of the animated series American Dad! On September 30, 2015, the departure of keyboardist Tay Strathairn was announced in a Facebook post.
More From Esquire. On Winning Dylan's Fans Over. I feel like we're very lucky in the sense that Dawes can be the kind of band that plays with Bright Eyes or M. Ward but that also plays with Bob Dylan. I don't know if there are a lot of bands of guys in their twenties that can do that.
The band made their television debut on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on April 14, 2010. Dawes released their second album, Nothing Is Wrong, on June 7, 2011 and toured the US co-headlining with Blitzen Trapper.
Dawes have debuted their music video for âAll Your Favorite Bandsâ and the video can be seen on Pitchfork or via [â¦]. + MORE.
Dawes is composed of brothers Taylor (guitars and vocals) and Griffin Goldsmith (drums), along with Wylie Gelber (bass) and Tay Strathairn (keyboards).
Dawes was formed from the band Simon Dawes after the departure of co-songwriter Blake Mills, subsequently abandoning a post-punk sound in favor of folk rock. Dawes has been described as having a Laurel Canyon sound derived from artists such as Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. At the invitation of producer Jonathan Wilson, the band joined a local informal jam session that included Conor Oberst, The Black Crowes 's Chris Robinson, and Benmont Tench.

But Iâve also read that caffeine can lower your immune systemâs defenses and may make you more susceptible to fluâs and colds. Like most medical advice, itâs mixed. My dad split the difference and had one cup of coffee with his breakfast and one cup of tea with his dinner. He had water or a cup of juice with lunch.
To me, as long as you're drinking a bottle of water with it I see no harm. You get hydrated from coffee. Of course you need to drink water in general, but the concept of drinking cups of water to balance out dehydration from coffee is just a myth.
Coffee is all about science â in fact, the drink has over 1,000 aroma compounds â especially when we talk about coffee cooling down and then heating it back up. Karen Yates from Bean Thinking, a blog devoted to the science in your cup, helped me wade through some of the scientific research out there.
How a coffee's chemistry changes as it cools down all depends on how you store the coffee and how long you wait for it to cool/leave the coffee before you microwave it, says Yates. That's why you love that initial smell when you first brew your cup of coffee, but it wears off as you drink it.
In other words, if you are drinking coffee because you love the process of drinking coffee, then the sensory aspect is more important to you â so it's worth it to brew a fresh cup. But if you are someone who is just trying to down a cup for the caffeine, microwave away!
There are definitely benefits to cold-brewed coffee because it's more alkaline. The body functions best when in a relatively alkaline state. A more alkaline drink helps your digestive system, which explains why your stomach flips with hot coffee but stays stable with a cold-brew.
After months of bitter cold, it's finally, finally, iced coffee season. It's that glorious, warm time of year when you can sit outside sipping an icy cup of your favorite cold brew, enjoying the sunshine without being bundled up in eight different layers.
Personally, I think when you are sick, your system canât take something as strong as coffee. A weak cup of herbal tea is just about right for a person in the throes of fighting the flu. Of course, there are any number of plants, herbs, and bark that can be made into a tea.
I've had doctors say it's ok to drink coffee while sick, some say other wise. 99% of the time people recommend tea. I'm just curious to what reddit thinks. If you're a coffee addict, you should definitely drink your normal amount. Definitely, an irritable sick person with a headache is no fun. There is powder caffeine for this purpose if you really need your fix but for a true coffee addict, nothing but the elixir itself will do.
Iced coffees are made in a variety of ways, but essentially they come down to two formats. First, you can make hot coffee the way you normally would and then cool it by letting it drip directly into ice. The second format is a cold-brew. With this method, as the name indicates, the coffee is never hot.

Treatment options for muscle weakness. Once theyâve determined the cause of your muscle weakness, your doctor will recommend appropriate treatment.

But if you develop persistent muscle weakness, or muscle weakness with no apparent cause or normal explanation, it may be a sign of an underlying health problem. Voluntary muscle contractions are usually generated when your brain sends a signal through your spinal cord and nerves to a muscle.

For other types of depression, see Mood disorder. Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause.
His depression left him ânot able to do anything one day out of three,â choking on his âbitter mortification.â He despaired of the weakness of mind that ran in his family. âThe ârace is for the strong,â â Darwin wrote. âI shall probably do little more but be content to admire the strides others made in Science.â.
The risk alleles for major depression, suggest authors Charles Raison and Andrew Miller, could be maintained because theyâre also involved in pathogen host defense (or PATHOS-D, as they call their hypothesis) systems of the immune system.
This would, in turn, cause the lowered levels of monoamines. This hypothesis received support from a PET study, which found significantly elevated activity of MAO-A in the brain of some depressed people. In genetic studies, the alterations of MAO-A-related genes have not been consistently associated with depression.

The purpose of this website is to share general information about depression and to also share progressive healing information about hypnosis and how it is involved in the cause and the cure of depression.
In fact, the analytic-rumination hypothesis is merely the latest attempt to explain the prevalence of depression. There is, for example, the âplea for helpâ theory, which suggests that depression is a way of eliciting assistance from loved ones. Thereâs also the âsignal of defeatâ hypothesis, which argues that feelings of despair after a loss in social status help prevent unnecessary attacks; weâre too busy sulking to fight back.
The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person's reported experiences and a mental status examination. There is no laboratory test for major depression. Testing, however, may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms.
Biology of depression. Scientific studies have found that numerous brain areas show altered activity in patients suffering from depression, and this has encouraged advocates of various theories that seek to identify a biochemical origin of the disease, as opposed to theories that emphasize psychological or situational causes.
An hypothesis is a specific statement of prediction. It describes in concrete (rather than theoretical) terms what you expect will happen in your study. Not all studies have hypotheses. Sometimes a study is designed to be exploratory (see inductive research). There is no formal hypothesis, and perhaps the purpose of the study is to explore some area more thoroughly in order to develop some specific hypothesis or prediction that can be tested in future research.

Cashmere. Cashmere the fiber of kings, produced from the lowly Cashmere goat. This fiber is so luxurious that the Arc of the Covenant of the old testament was lined and curtained with it.
Nearly all goats have two coats. The top layer is called guard hair, and the undercoat is a down. Some goats have such exquisite down that itâs turned into highly-coveted cashmere. Beth Bohnert raises goats for cashmere on her small farm in Tennessee. She says cashmere isnât a specific breed of goat, itâs a type of goat.
A cashmere goat is any breed of goat that produces cashmere wool, the goat's fine, soft, downy, winter undercoat, in commercial quality and quantity.
Most common goat breeds, including dairy goats, grow this two-coated fleece. The down is produced by secondary follicles, the guard hair by the primary follicles. In 1994, China had an estimated population of 123 million goats and is the largest producer of cashmere down. Local breeds are dominant.
Sixty percent of the worlds supply of cashmere is produced in China and the remainder from Turkey, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Kashmere, Australia and New Zealand. It is a new industry for the United States. The first Cashmere goats were imported from Australia and New Zealand in the late 1980's. Since then several Cashmere breeders and growers have been producing breeding stock to launch this new industry in the US.
The Changthangi or Pashmina goat is found in Ladakh and Baltistan (Kashmir region). They are raised for cashmere production and used as pack animals. The breed is most often white, but black, gray and brown animals also occur.
How to Harvest Cashmere. Cashmere is the down that grows on a cashmere goat during late summer an autumn to protect the goat with extra warmth during winter. It's the short, soft fibre growing close to the skin, underneath the more coarse hair. Getting the cashmere for use in human products is a case of accurate timing and good after-care for the goats to ensure that they don't suffer from the cold. Here is how to harvest cashmere.
Raising a goat for its cashmere isnât much different than other goats â except for its diet. You donât want to feed a lot of protein because when you do it coarsens their cashmere, says Bohnert. So, the goatsâ diet in their natural setting is primarily browse, which is weeds and leaves, theyâll eat berries.
Promote drainage. Home remedies that open and hydrate the sinuses may promote drainage. See Sinus Infection Home Remedies for information on increasing daily fluid intake, inhaling steam, taking expectorants and pain relievers, and nasal saline irrigation.
Decongestants help reduce airway obstruction and are important in the initial treatment to alleviate symptoms. 1  OTC nasal sprays: oxymetazoline (Afrin), phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine), naphazoline (Naphcon), and chlorzoxazone (Forte) work the fastest, within one to three minutes.
Show Full Comment. Comment: Afrin is cheap and effective. I've used it nightly (left-side only) for over 40 years. It keeps my nose open and allows very comfortable nose-breathing all night. In the morning and through the day, when I'm up and around, my nose stays open very well.
The resultant sinus cavity hypoxia and mucus retention cause the ciliaâwhich move mucus and debris from the noseâto function less efficiently, creating an environment for bacterial growth. If the acute sinusitis does not resolve, chronic sinusitis can develop from mucus retention, hypoxia, and blockade of the ostia.
The inflammation can predispose to the development of acute sinusitis by causing sinus ostial blockage. Although inflammation in any of the sinuses can lead to blockade of the sinus ostia, the most commonly involved sinuses in both acute and chronic sinusitis are the maxillary and the anterior ethmoid sinuses.

Reduce inflammation. Blood cells and lining cells of the mucosa in the sinuses can normally fight off foreign invaders. However, when overwhelmed by viruses or bacteria, coupled with a depressed immune system or over-reactivity to allergens, the result is the inflammation associated with sinusitis. With appropriate therapy, a short-lived infection can be treated effectively.
The most common cause of acute sinusitis is an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) of viral origin. The viral infection can lead to inflammation of the sinuses that usually resolves without treatment in less than 14 days.

RVR has provided 5 renovated coaches for the service, and will initially operate four trips a day between Kampala and Namanve, around 14 km east of the capital on the main line towards the Kenyan border at Jinja.
It was originally anticipated that the contract on new train supply and maintenance would be signed in September 2011, but the contract was eventually signed seven or eight months later, said RVR Director General Lazars Raizbergs.
Under the new agreement, Trans-Century s interests in RVR will now revert to a new special purpose vehicle by the name, Safari Rail Ltd that will hold 34 per cent of RVR shares.
Afib with RVR explained. Posted on July 6, 2011 by a4arif. Afib with rvr is the abbreviation of Atrial fibrillation with a ârapid ventricular responseâ and it is a heart condition develops when the electrical pulses which coordinate the contractions of the twinned-chambers of the heart begins to work improperly.
If the ventricular rate (heart chamber vibrations) is below 100 beats per minute, the condition is termed as Atrial Fibrillation with controlled or Slow Ventricular Response (SVR).If the Ventricular rate is over 100 beats per minute, then it is referred to as Uncontrolled or Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR).
Working of the heart: To easily identify atrial fibrillation with RVR, it is vital to understand the working of the heart. The atrium or atria (plural) is the upper chamber of the heart, bigger in size compared to the lower chambers known as the ventricles.
RVR Group CEO Darlan de David said RVR will be expanding its presence in Gulu and eventually transforming the town into a logistical hub for its operations in northern Uganda and the surrounding regions.

What is Atrial fibrillation with RVR? Atrial fibrillation with RVR (Rapid Ventricular Response) is a heart condition caused by irregular electrical activity that results in irregular contractions of the heart walls and its chambers.
The estates of the realm were the broad social orders of the hierarchically conceived society, recognised in the Middle Ages and Early Modern period in Christian Europe. There was no single system of dividing society into estates, and systems developed over time.The best known system is the French three-estate system that was used until the French Revolution: the clergy (first estate), the nobility (second estate), and commoners (third estate).Some countries considered burghers and rural commoners separate estates, notably Scandinavian nations and Russia.n addition, the First and Second Estates relied on the labour of the Third, which made the latter's unequal status all the more glaring. There were an estimated 27 million people in the Third Estate when the French Revolution started. Men and women shared the hard life of physical labour and food shortages.

The least important side effects are constipation (aluminum-containing antacids) or diarrhea (magnesium-containing antacids. Large amounts of calcium carbonate-containing antacids (for example, Tums) can affect the balances of calcium and acid in the body and damage the kidneys.
1 Brands with magnesium may cause diarrhea. 2  Brands with calcium or aluminum may cause constipation. 3  Rarely, brands with calcium may cause kidney stones or other problems. 4  If you take large amounts of antacids that contain aluminum, you may be at risk for calcium loss, which can lead to weak bones (osteoporosis).

Large amounts of calcium carbonate-containing antacids (for example, Tums) can affect the balances of calcium and acid in the body and damage the kidneys. Calcium-containing antacids also can stimulate acid secretion even though initially they neutralize acid.
The least important side effects are constipation (aluminum-containing antacids) or diarrhea (magnesium-containing antacids). Large amounts of calcium carbonate-containing antacids (for example, Tums) can affect the balances of calcium and acid in the body and damage the kidneys.
You may have side effects from taking these medicines. Antacids are made with 3 basic ingredients. If you have problems, try another brand. 1  Brands with magnesium may cause diarrhea. 2  Brands with calcium or aluminum may cause constipation. 3  Rarely, brands with calcium may cause kidney stones or other problems.
1 Aluminum hydroxide can cause constipation. 2  Because it can build up in the kidneys, don't take it if you have kidney problems. 3  Also, aluminum hydroxide antacids may reduce substances in your blood required for energy, called phosphates.
1 Antacids that contain magnesium have a laxative effect that may cause diarrhea, and in patients with renal failure they may cause increased magnesium levels in the blood, because of the reduced ability of the kidneys to eliminate magnesium from the body in the urine.
1 If you have kidney problems, check with your doctor before you use aluminum-based antacids. 2  Magnesium compounds (such as Phillips' Milk of Magnesia) may cause diarrhea. 3  Combination aluminum-magnesium antacids are less likely to cause constipation or diarrhea than are aluminum-only or magnesium-only antacids.
Antacids work by neutralizing the acid in your stomach. They also make reflux less acidic, causing less damage to your esophagus. Antacids may also increase lower esophageal sphincter pressure, causing less reflux. Each type of antacid can cause different side effects.
Supportive means that the author has positive feelings and uses positive language/connotations to express his/her ideas. Unsupportive means that the author has negative feelings and uses negative language/connotations to express his/her ideas. NEUTRAL means in the middle-- not expressing ANY feelings or expressing both sides of an issue. To determine the Author's POINT of VIEW, listen to the TONE of the message in which he/she writes.
Remember, an author may color his/her ideas with these or any other emotions. A keen reader recognizes these attitudes or tones by identifying the subject, the length and flow. of the sentences, the atmosphere, the word meanings/contexts/ connotations, the point of view and purpose of the author.
Therefore, emotions and attitudes are distinct affective states, even though an attitude may lead to an emotional response and then to a feeling or bodily response, as in a students negative attitude toward writing resulting in anger and perspiration.
Most students in the class also feared writing, a common and tragic cultural attitude toward writing, and one we, as teachers, should address directly in our classes and in our professional organizations.

1 Remove the fish from the freezer and dip each individual fish into a bowl of ice water. 2  Place back on the baking sheet and freeze again. 3  Repeat this process until the fish has an ice coating built up to at least 1/8 inch thick. 4  Place the glazed fish into an airtight freezer bag or container.
COOKING. Do the following: Review with your counselor the injuries that might arise from cooking, including burns and scalds, and the proper treatment. Describe how meat, fish, chicken, eggs, dairy products, and fresh vegetables should be stored, transported, and properly prepared for cooking. Describe the following food-related illnesses and tell what you can do to help prevent each from happening:
Store it in a shallow covered container to allow the fish to cool to the proper temperature more quickly. Cooked fish can be stored for up to 2 to 3 days in a refrigerator at 40Â°F or less. If leftovers are not going to be used within this time, they can be frozen and stored for up to one month.
Storing dairy products for export. If you store dairy products intended for export, you need to operate under a registered Risk Management Programme (RMP). This ensures that your products meet all the export requirements for New Zealand and also those of destination markets.
Storing and transporting dairy products for the New Zealand market. If you store or transport dairy products intended for sale in New Zealand, you can choose to operate under an RMP or a Food Safety Programme (FSP) under the Food Act 1981. New Zealand Legislation: Animal Products (Exemptions and Inclusions) Order 2000 (External website).
1 If the fish cannot be kept alive, be sure to store them at a temperature below 40Â°F. 2  Storing them in a cooler with plenty of ice will keep them cold you are ready to clean and store properly. 3  When cleaning the fish, be careful not to contaminate the meat when removing the stomach and intestine contents.
Prepare and server for yourself and two others, the two dinners, one lunch, and one breakfast. Time your cooking so that each course will be ready to serve at the proper time. The meals for this requirement may be prepared for different trips. They need not be prepared consecutively.
1 For ease in handling and to prevent splashing of the oil when the fish is placed in the hot oil, it is best to use small pieces of fish. 2  Any utensils and equipment that come into contact with the hot oil must be thoroughly dried first. 3  Moisture on the utensils will cause splattering, which can be dangerous.
Code of Practice (COP) for stores. You can use an industry-agreed COP specifically for animal products storage to help you develop an RMP for storing dairy products. Cold and dry stores â Code of practice. You can find further information about meeting requirements in the Stores (cold & dry) section of the website.
Under the Animal Products Act (APA) 1999, the definition of a dairy processor includes the storage and transport of dairy products. This means anyone transporting or storing dairy product is captured by the APA and needs to operate under a registered RMP unless an exemption, such as described in the Order applies.
North Korea has been reported to have sold rare earth metals to China. During May and June 2014, North Korea sold over US$1.88 million worth of rare earth metals to China. Other sources suggest that North Korea has the world's second largest reserve of rare earth metals, with potentially over 20 million tons in total.
That day has come. Today, every Prius hybrid car on the road carries with it about 10 pounds of lanthanum. And yet, most Prius owners don't even know they use this rare earth element every day. The metal in question is lanthanum, but what can we sayÂ­, rare earth elements get no respect. A big breakthrough in battery technology, nickel-lanthanum hydride batteries pack more power into a smaller spaceâthey're about twice as efficient as the standard lead-acid car battery.
Rare earth metals are actually not as rare as their name might imply. Critical to high-performance optics and lasers and key to the most powerful magnets and superconductors in the world, rare earths are simply difficult to mine than most metals and generally don't accumulate into rich ores.
The relative risks to the supply of some of Earth's rarest elements have been detailed in a new list published by the British Geological Survey (BGS). So-called technology metals like indium and niobium are extracted from the Earth and are used in a wide range of modern digital devices and green technologies. They are therefore increasingly in demand from global industries. The list highlights 52 elements most at risk from supply disruption.
Image caption Mobile phones incorporate a wide range of the rare earth elements. There are many more locations on Earth where these critical metals can be mined, including varied geological deposits from Southern Africa, Australia, Brazil, and the US.
It isn't astatine any longer. This element has a half life of roughly 8 hours, meaning if you could get a clump of it to stay on a table (you can't), half of it would disintegrate in 8 hours, and then every 8 hours another half would go until in a few days, there'd be no astatine on the table.
These rare-earth oxides are used as tracers to determine which parts of a drainage basin are eroding. A rare earth element (REE) or rare earth metal (REM), as defined by IUPAC, is one of a set of seventeen chemical elements in the periodic table, specifically the fifteen lanthanides, as well as scandium and yttrium.
Rarer than any metal, any mineral, so rare that if you scan the entire earth, all six million billion billion kilos or 13,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds of our planet, you would find only one ounce of it?
Meet the Rarest Natural Element on Earth. It's so rare, there's just 30 grams TOTAL in Earth's crust. Named after the Greek word for unstable (astatos), Astatine is a naturally occurring semi-metal that results from the decay of uranium and thorium. In its most stable form - astatine-210 - it's got a half-life of just 8.1 hours, which means even if you did happen to stumble on some of it, half of it would be gone by the end of a work day.
Some of you will say that another element, francium (atomic number 87), is even more unstable than astatine, and you're right. As Sam writes, If you had a million atoms of the longest-lived type of astatine, half of them would disintegrate in 400 minutes. A similar sample of francium would hang on for 20 minutes.

Lock bumping. A typical bump key. Lock bumping is a lock picking technique for opening a pin tumbler lock using a specially crafted bump key, rapping key or a 999 key. A bump key must correspond to the target lock in order to function correctly.
Bumping a Lock. 1  1. Insert the key into the lock. Fit the key into the lock. 2  2. Begin turning the key. Try turning the key in the unlock direction (usually counterclockwise). 3  3. Strike the back of the key with a blunt object.
Bump keys are keys cut to a special design that will allow them to be used for picking pin-tumbler locks. Pin-tumbler locks are the world's most popular lock, and these include exterior door entry locks for homes. The process of gaining entry using a bump key is called âbumping,â and it can be very effective.
Things You Need to Make a Bump Key. Blank keys for your specific lock. A depth and/or spacing guide for your lock manufacturer's keys, OR. A digital caliper to measure depth and spacing, plus a real cut key for your (or a similar) lock. A triangular or taper file or a key clipper.
Making a Bump Key. 1  1. Start with an ordinary key. Find a key that fits into the lock youâre attempting to bump. 2  2. Identify the position of the valleys in the teeth. Look at the key and observe the spacing of the teeth. 3  3. File the valleys down to their lowest position.
Things You Need to Make a Bump Key. 1  Blank keys for your specific lock. 2  A depth and/or spacing guide for your lock manufacturer's keys, OR. 3  A digital caliper to measure depth and spacing, plus a real cut key for your (or a similar) lock.  A triangular or taper file or a key 1  clipper. This bump key guide :)
How to Make a Bump Key. Using these values, you'll make your first cut using the first value (key shoulder to first cut), then each subsequent cut will be spaced at equal intervals using the second value (distance between centers). As a general rule, you cut to the indented line on the blank key.
The Bump Key. A bump key is required for lock bumping to be effective. The key must be the appropriate size for the lock, but the only other requirement is that each ridge in the key is cut to maximum depth. People often refer to bump keys as â999 keysâ because each ridge is cut to a depth of nine in a key-making machine.
Use a bump key when you lock yourself out of your own home, or when you need to gain access to a friend's home during a crisis. Lock bumping ordinarily leaves no signs of damage or tampering. When you bump a lock, the energy from the strike moves through the key to the bottom pins.
All the cuts on a bump key are made to the maximum depth, so any key blank can be made into a bump key. Bump keys are manufacturer-specific. A Kwikset lock requires a bump key made from a Kwikset key. The same is true for other lock brands. So, a full set of bump keys would include one for each of the major lockset manufacturers.

In 1926, RCA (Radio Corporation of America) formed the first national network, called NBC (National Broadcasting Company).

This first 'Standards and Practices' booklet soon became yet another standard throughout the industry. It was 6 by 9 inches and is 80 pages long.

Ingredients for Homemade Laundry Soap. Recommended fats for making laundry soap are coconut oil, tallow, lard, palm oil, and palm kernel oil. The superfatting level is generally agreed to be 0%. Our skin can use the extra oils provided by superfatting.
1.8 ounces (51 grams) of borax per ounce of soap. 2.2 ounces (60 grams) of washing soda per ounce of soap. The mixture is stirred until the borax and washing soda dissolve. This concentrate is poured into a larger container, and 1 quart of hot water per ounce of soap is added.
When you add the potassium hydroxide it will sound like it is going to explode or boil over, but the water does not bubble up at all and it doesnt even heat us as much as sodium hydroxide so dont worry.. One more note, I am one of those risk taking soapers who doesnt even wear gloves when making soap.
1 Use 5% castor oil to help with trace and lather. 2  Use 1 teaspoon of sugar per pound of oils to help with trace and lather. 3  Substitute KOH for 5% of the NaOH. (Courtesy of Curious Soapmaker)  Add a small amount of finished soap to help emulsify the lye and oils.
-add 70g of sulfated if you are using it, and fragrance. If you get the mixture too hot, you may want to wait for the solution to cool down a bit to add the fragrance, otherwise it will vaporize. Let it cool and voila, liquid soap. It seems complicated at first, but once you do it a few times it becomes much clearer.
Now this is a stage you have to look out for. This is what your soap looks like just before it starts to puff up and out of the pot. What happens is that the soap gets too hot (you notice that it is in the double boiler.) and it doubles in size.
Economy is the main reason most people make their own laundry soap--that and control of contents. Control of contents would be the main reason for making dog soap. However, it's important to avoid the contents that are not good for dogs, and not all handcrafted dog soap recipes do that.
Solid soap is simply grated and used like laundry detergent. Usually, borax and washing soda are also used in the wash load, in accordance with their manufacturer's quantity directions. Some soapmakers incorporate the borax and washing soda into the soap formulation.
Buy everything you need for Heavy Duty Laundry Soap Recipe (except the shredded soap and vinegar) with the click of a button! Note: Vinegar is optional, but can be added to reduce the need for dryer sheets or other fabric softening aids.
Put the soap into the top of your double boiler and bring the heat up. It. will make a very stiff paste, I don't bother to try and mix it, it is far too thick. Check your mixture twice for separation 20 min apart. You have to pry the paste away from the bottom of the pot.

weather and science facts. Average annual temperatures for cities, towns, parks and lakes throughout Oregon are listed below in degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius. The tables give the normals for maximum and minimum yearly temperatures based on weather data collected from 1981 to 2010.
Temperatures range from daytime highs in the 50s, to low 40s. It will get below freezing several times and often into the 20s for a day or two. It rains a lot during these four months, but the temperatures are not extreme like in other interior states of the country.
Summer weather really starts in July and ends in September. Summer temperatures average around 80 degrees but do go over a 100 for one or two days a year. Overnight temperatures average around 60 degrees. This is a 90 day period that typically has very little (and sometimes none) rain. The summer is really one of the best parts about Portland.
Because of its location in the center of North America, the Twin Cities region is subjected to some of the widest range of temperatures in the United States. Temperatures in the Twin Cities region range from an average of 15.6 Â°F (â9.1 Â°C) in January to 73.8 Â°F (23.2 Â°C) in July.
On the coldest nights, it can drop to 20 Â°F (-7 Â°C) or below at Portland. But weather that cold doesn't happen here every year. Days per month on average in Portland when the minimum temperature drops to 40, 32 Â°F or below.

Material. Microfiber is constructed in a blend of 80/20 ratio of polyester/polyamideams. They are made from a warp knitted thread, composed of wedge-shaped polyester filaments with a core of nylon.
Microfiber or microfibre is synthetic fiber finer than one denier or decitex /thread. This is smaller than the diameter of a strand of silk, which is itself about 1/5 the diameter of a human hair. The most common types of microfibers are made from polyesters, polyamides (e.g., nylon, Kevlar, Nomex, trogamide), or a conjugation of polyester, polyamide, and polypropylene (Prolen). Microfiber is used to make mats, knits, and weaves for apparel, upholstery, industrial filters, and cleaning products.
I didn't know when I bought it that microfiber is polyester, and I am not a lover of polyester. But, forget the polyester connection. I have NEVER felt sheets as soft as my microfiber sheets. They are so lovely to sleep in, and so light and caressing, the closest I could think of is silk.
Also, seeing as microfiber is such a cheap cost product, the majority of the furniture it is used on will also be of equally cheap construction. A quality furniture making company is not going to cover their superior quality constructed pieces in an inferior fabric option. Common sense!
Put some of the liquid on *both* sides of the stain and rub in very gently. Let it sit for a couple of hours, and rinse it with cool water. I got probably 1/4 of a cup of oily salad dressing out of a pillowcase using that method. My linens aren't microfiber, but this method worked.
Functional uses. Microfiber performance apparel has become a very popular alternative to cotton apparel for athletic wear, such as cycling jerseys, because the microfiber material wicks moisture away from the body, keeping the athlete cool and dry.
It's particularly bad if I haven't been for a pedicure and the bottoms of my feet feel like they're putting runs in the fabric. To me, there's just nothing like the cool, crisp feel of cotton sheets. My mom recently moved in across the street from us and brought my 40 yr old bedsheets.
It's a very soft feel and I like the fabric but have not slept on them. I love all cotton sheets and would love to try linen sheets. I'm a natural fiber person, but I like the microfiber too. I would just want to see them and feel them before purchasing so I would know what I was getting.
Microfiber products used for consumer cleaning are generally constructed from split conjugated fibers of polyester and polyamide. Microfiber used for commercial cleaning products also includes many products constructed of 100% polyester microfiber.
Clothing. While the use of microfiber for clothing has been around for some years now, it is most often found in sports apparel due to its ability to wick away sweat. The material can also be found in medical compression socks, which are used to help patients increase blood flow.

PMI, also known as private mortgage insurance, is a type of mortgage insurance from private insurance companies used with conventional loans. Similar to other kinds of mortgage insurance policies, PMI protects the lender if you stop making payments on your home loan.
FHA mortgage insurance premium, or MIP, is a type of insurance policy that protects lenders if an FHA loan holder defaults on his or her mortgage. This insurance allows lenders to issue FHA loans requiring very small down payments and at low rates. FHA MIP reduces lender risk, and the benefits are passed onto the borrower.
In addition, there is an upfront mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP) required for FHA loans equal to 1.75% of the loan amount. FHA Streamline Refinance Program: Could you be paying less? You may be entitled to a partial FHA MIP refund if refinancing into another FHA loan within 3 years.

You may have a higher rate of MIP than what is available today. Here is a history of FHA MIP. Prior to January 2008 : 0.50% annual MIP; October 2008 : 0.55% annual MIP
You are typically required to pay a private mortgage insurance premium on a conventional loan for as many months or years it takes to build enough equity in your home to equal 20 percent of your homeâs value and have a loan-to-value ratio of 80 percent.
In general, there are two types of mortgage insurance: mortgage insurance bought from the government, designed for those with FHA loans (this is called mortgage insurance premiums or MIP) or private mortgage insurance for conventional loans which is bought from the private sector (this is called private mortgage insurance or PMI).
So, if you bought a home with a value of $300,000, you might pay about $150 per month for private mortgage insurance. On FHA loans, there is an up-front MIP (mortgage insurance premium) and annual premium which is collected monthly. 4. When do I pay PMI premiums?
Meanwhile, supported by aid from China and the Soviet Union, North Vietnam strengthened its air defenses. By November 1967, the number of American troops in Vietnam was approaching 500,000, and U.S. casualties had reached 15,058 killed and 109,527 wounded.
January 27, 1973: The Paris Peace Accords are signed by the U.S., North Vietnam, South Vietnam and the Viet Cong. Under the terms, the U.S. agrees to immediately halt all military activities and withdraw all remaining military personnel within 60 days.
MAY 22, 1972 - AMERICA IS FED UP WITH THE WAR. (Hulton Archive/Getty Images). The greatest opposition to the Vietnam War was the opposition to the draft. In all, 1,728,344 males, age 20 to 26, were drafted to serve. Twenty-five percent of total forces in Vietnam were draftees.
By MICHAEL IP. Forty years ago, on March 29, 1973, the United States ended its military involvement in Vietnam. Although the war would continue another two years, the South Vietnamese would no longer receive American assistance.
More than 3 million people (including 58,000 Americans) were killed in the Vietnam War; more than half were Vietnamese civilians. By 1969, at the peak of U.S. involvement in the war, more than 500,000 U.S. military personnel were involved in the Vietnam conflict. Growing opposition to the war in the United States led to bitter divisions among Americans, both before and after President Richard Nixon ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 1973.
The United States became involved in the Vietnam War after the defeat of the French forces in 1954. The U.S. goal was to avoid a Communist takeover and to maintain production â¦ of rubber, which was a very important commodity prior to the use of modern steel-belted tires with synthetic treads.
In  1964, U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson reported that North Vietnam  had attacked U.S. Navy ships along Vietnam's coast. Nearly 80,000  U.S. troops were in South Vietnam by the end of 1965. . The United  States conducted a brutal air war against North Vietnam.
Seeking to regain control of the region, France backed Bao and set up the state of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in July 1949, with Saigon as its capital. Armed conflict continued until a decisive battle at Dien Bien Phu in May 1954 ended in French defeat by Viet Minh forces.
By 1969, at  the height of the war, the United States had about 543,000 troops  in Vietnam. Many of them were teenagers. The average age of  Americans fighting in Vietnam was 19.    END OF THE WAR Although Nixon increased the bombing of North  Vietnam, he began withdrawing U.S. troops. Without U.S. support,  South Vietnam's government collapsed. North Vietnam won the war in  1975. Vietnam was reunited as a Communist nation.
With the Cold War intensifying, the United States hardened its policies against any allies of the Soviet Union, and by 1955 President Dwight D. Eisenhower had pledged his firm support to Diem and South Vietnam.
Tesla is now a battery company first, and a car company second. Tesla isnât creating a new market, though. The Tesla Powerwall is not exactly the first home battery of its kind. Others exist. Most home batteries function approximately like this: batteries charge at night, when utility companyâs rates are the lowest, and can then be switched on in the morning so homeowners can enjoy that cheap energy throughout the day.
Teslaâs new âPowerwallâ home battery will cost $3,500 for 10kWh units [Updated] Elon Musk extols the virtues of battery power in an evening press conference. Megan Geuss - May 1, 2015 6:00 am UTC
The home stationary battery will be called the Powerwall, and it will cost $3,500 for a 10kWh unit. That unit is optimized to deal with serving a house if the traditional power grid goes down. A cheaper, $3,000 version will have a 7kWh capacity, and it will be able to help a house with solar panels deal with the daily fluctuations in energy supply.
The new Tesla Powerwall battery, which can clearly be used for either home or business use, is one more notch in the belt for Elon Musk. Itâs a wall-mounted rechargeable Lithium-ion battery that looks way more stylish than its competitors.

Tesla's CEO Elon Musk announced the details of the long-awaited home battery, called the Powerwall, in a battery-powered conference on April 30.
The home stationary battery will be called the Powerwall, and it will cost  $3,500 for a 10kWh unit. That unit is optimized to deal with serving a house if the traditional power grid goes down. A cheaper, $3,000 version will have a 7kWh capacity, and it will be able to help a house with solar panels deal with the daily fluctuations in energy supply.
Currently Tesla estimates the Powerwall 2 battery plus supporting hardware will cost $8750 in Australia, not including installation costs. This doesn't include a solar PV array. Prices may vary between suppliers. The battery is smartly styled and designed for easy connection into the home power system.

1 Draw the resultant from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector. Label this vector as Resultant or simply R.  Using a ruler, measure the length of the resultant and determine its magnitude by converting to real units using the scale (4.4 cm x 20 m/1 cm = 88 m).
Chapter 3: VECTORS. 1. We say that the displacement of a particle is a vector quantity. Our best justiÂ¯cation for this. assertion is: A. displacement can be speciÂ¯ed by a magnitude and a direction. B. operating with displacements according to the rules for manipulating vectors leads to re-. sults in agreement with experiments.
Since the northward displacement and the eastward displacement are at right angles to each other, the Pythagorean theorem can be used to determine the resultant (i.e., the hypotenuse of the right triangle). The result of adding 11 km, north plus 11 km, east is a vector with a magnitude of 15.6 km. Later, the method of determining the direction of the vector will be discussed. Let's test your understanding with the following two practice problems.
C. a displacement is obviously not a scalar. D. displacement can be speciÂ¯ed by three numbers. E. displacement is associated with motion. ans: B. Section: 3{2; DiÂ±culty: E. 2. The vectors ~a, ~b,and~c are related by ~c = ~b Â¡ ~a.
Vector, in physics, a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. It is typically represented by an arrow whose direction is the same as that of the quantity and whose length is proportional to the quantityâs magnitude. Although a vector has magnitude and direction, it does not have position. That is, as long as its length is not changed, a vector is not altered if it is displaced parallel to itself. In contrast to vectors, ordinary quantities that have a magnitude but not a direction are called scalars. For example, displacement, velocity, and acceleration are vector quantities, while speed (the magnitude of velocity), time, and mass are scalars. To qualify as a vector, a quantity having magnitude and direction must also obey certain rules of combination.
Find the magnitude and direction of the vector sum R1 where R1 = A + B . The vector A. = 15.9 m at an angle 180 degrees from the positive horizontal axis, and the vector B = 8.7 m at an angle 70.2 degrees from the positive horizontal axis. Answer in units of m.
Find the magnitude and direction of the vector sum R1 where R1 = A + B . = 15.9 m at an angle 180 degrees from the positive horizontal axis, and the vector B = 8.7 m at an angle 70.2 degrees from the positive horizontal axis. Answer in units of m.
1 Pick a starting location and draw the first vector to scale in the indicated direction. Label the magnitude and direction of the scale on the diagram (e.g., SCALE: 1 cm = 20 m).  Starting from where the head of the first vector ends, draw the second vector to scale in the indicated direction.
The magnitude and direction of the sum of two or more vectors can also be determined by use of an accurately drawn scaled vector diagram. Using a scaled diagram, the head-to-tail method is employed to determine the vector sum or resultant. A common Physics lab involves a vector walk.
The vector A has no Y component, since it lies on the x axis opposite to its positive direction, so it has a magnitude of - 15.9 m on that axis. For B vector the y component will be sin(70.2 degrees)* 8.7 or in terms of radians sin (70.2/360* 6.28)= .94 thus the y component is .94*8.7= 8.18m.

The highest dividend stocks in the Dow are: As you'll note, one relatively common aspect of most Dow components is they tend to be multinationals -- in other words, they operate all around the globe.
Further, the holding period could be modified such that when one of the top ten falls into the bottom twenty group, it could be replaced with the stock that rose into the top ten. The following table can be ranked by yield (highest to lowest) to facilitate implementation of the Dogs of the Dow strategy.
1 The table can be sorted by clicking on the column headings of Stock (for an alphabetical listing) or Dividend Yield (for a descending value listing).  The Dogs of the Dow investment strategy is to maintain a portfolio that consists of the ten DJIA stocks with the highest yields. Conventionally, equal amounts are invested in each of the the ten stocks at the beginning of the year and held for one year.
NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average is made up of 30 blue-chip stocks, and it's weighted to represent the various industries in the U.S. economy in proportion. All 30 of those stocks pay dividends. We've systematically ranked them to show you the 10 best dividend stocks in the Dow. Our aim was to find a particular type of equity: high-quality dividend growth stocks with strong competitive advantages suitable for long-term investors.
Verizon Wireless stands out from the other Dow stocks thanks to its high dividend yield of 4.6% -- it pays out 62% of its profits as dividends. The company has paid steady or increasing dividends for 31 consecutive years.
The highest dividend stocks in the Dow: One avenue commonly explored by income investors is the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 30 components. All 30 Dow stocks are (currently) profitable, and each is paying a dividend, ranging from 4.4% at the high end to 0.7% on the low end. Overall, though, the Dow's average dividend yield in the mid-2% range is higher than the approximate average dividend yield of 2% currently being paid by S&P 500 companies. Five of the Dow's components could arguably be classified as high-yield dividend plays, which I'm defining as any stock yielding 3.5% or higher.
Dividend Yield for Stocks in the. Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Estimated Dividend for each stock below is our best estimate of the per share amount that will be paid during the next year, beginning on Aug-18-2016. Most companies pay dividends on a quarterly frequency; some pay annually or semi-annually.
The table below includes and can be sorted on: company ticker symbol, company name, yield rank, dividend yield and market cap (in billions) as well as the stock's one-day, one-month, and 12-month percent change.
For summary statistics of these 10 highest dividend paying stocks as well as how they compare to the Dow, simply scroll down to view the summary table. This table is updated every day after the close.
For example, if General Electric (GE) paid out $0.17 per share during the most recent quarter, the forward annual dividend would be $0.68 ($0.17 times four). If General Electric's stock price was $19.42, its dividend yield would be 3.5% ($0.68 divided by $19.42).
The USDA also requires that eggs be sold under refrigeration, regardless of how they are washed, so even your super-crunchy health food stores are going to keep their eggs in the refrigerator or risk being shut down. The question is also connected to the health of egg-laying chicken.
To properly answer the question of how long do eggs last, how long are eggs good for, or the shelf life of eggs, a variety of factors must be examined such as the sell by date and how the eggs have been stored.
How long can you keep eggs in the fridge? Expert answer: We tell consumers to look to the egg carton sell-by dates to judge freshness. The USDA says that the date can be no farther ahead than 30 days after the packing date. Your store can choose any day within those 30 days to date the eggs.
Within that window of time, your eggs will be at their highest quality, meaning the yolk will be high and upstanding, and the white will be tall and firm when you whip them. According to Foodsafety.gov, raw eggs in the shell can be kept in the refrigerator for three to five weeks. Freezing in the shell is not recommended. Instead, crack those eggs, beat them, and then store them in a freezer-safe container. More: 10 smart ways to use up leftover egg yolks.
How long do hard boiled eggs last? Hard boiled eggs last about 7 days in the fridge, but can spoil quickly if not handled properly. Hard boiled eggs are fresh whole eggs that have been boiled for about 10 minutes. Chicken eggs are the most common choice for this process. Because of their relatively low-cost, high protein, versatility and portability hard boiled eggs are a popular protein choice.
Because it's easy to forget how long that carton of eggs has been lurking in the back of the fridge, and because the last thing you want to do is get your family or your roomies sick, we've cracked the code, so to speak, on the shelf life of eggs.
Seven days. That's it. Once you've boiled eggs, they have just one week until you should think twice about eating one. (That's assuming they've been stored in the fridge shortly after being boiled.) And if that hard boiled egg was peeled before being refrigerated, that knocks two more days off of its shelf life.
You can extend the answer to how long do hard boiled eggs last by storing them in your fridge (refrigerator) immediately after preparation or use. Once prepared, hard boiled eggs should be stored in a tightly closed container in the fridge to keep out moisture and other contaminants.
If that thought has got you nervous about the freshness of the eggs currently in your fridge, you can always give the water trick a try. Place the egg in a bowl of water and if it floats to the top, DO NOT EAT IT. It will make you very, very sick. If the egg sinks and lays on its side, you're good to go.
How Long Do Eggs Last? How long do eggs last in the fridge? Fresh eggs will last for at least 66 days from the date they are placed into a carton, this is 3-4 weeks beyond the stamped âbest byâ date on the carton. There are many things to consider with egg safety.

All little riders grow at different rates. So the best way of finding the right size bike for them is to look at models in their age range and then match their height to the right bike. Kidâs bikes are basically scaled down versions of adult bikes and are typically measured through wheel sizes. As a rule, itâs best to get your child to sit on a potential new bike and to check that they can touch the ground with both feet. For more information about choosing kid's bikes visit our buying guide.

Get the right size. âThe main thing with kidsâ bikes is having the right size bike for the rider,â says Jon Posner, store manager at Race Pace Bicycles in Ellicott City. Childrenâs bikes are measured by the diameter of the wheel, with sizes ranging from 12 inches to 24 inches. The appropriate size depends on the childâs age and height or leg length. For example, most 2-year-olds start on a 12-inch bike. To test proper fit, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends children sit on the seat with their hands on the handlebars.
Bikes like these usually come with stabiliser wheels to help with balance, coaster brakes (which work when pedalling backwards) and/or independent front & rear hand operated bar brakes (depending on brand). 1  Dawes Thunder 12 Inch 2017 Kids Bike Â£99.99.

The main segment of I-95 in New Jersey officially begins at the Delaware River-Turnpike Toll Bridge over the Delaware River in Burlington Township, Burlington County, where the road continues west into Pennsylvania as the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276).
Located in the northeastern part of the state near New York City, the 11.03-mile (17.75 km) Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike, considered to be Route 95W by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, is also part of I-95.
Southbound I-95 traffic headed to Delaware is directed to continue south on the New Jersey Turnpike and use the Delaware Memorial Bridge. The same is done in reverse: thru traffic on I-95 near Wilmington, Delaware is pointed to New Jersey and New York City via the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the New Jersey Turnpike. Meanwhile, traffic from Pennsylvania and Trenton is directed via I-295 and I-195.
Yet I-95 is discontinuous within New Jersey. From the Pennsylvania direction, I-95 enters New Jersey on the Scudder Falls Bridge and halts at the US 1 interchange, where the freeway turns south as I-295.

Forms of verse: Rhyming stanzas Form This is poetry that is divided into stanzas or verses (groups of lines) in which all or some of the lines have a rhyme word at the end.
In poetry, a stanza is a division of four or more lines having a fixed length, meter or rhyming scheme. Stanzas in poetry are similar to paragraphs in prose. Both stanzas and paragraphs include connected thoughts and are set off by a space. The number of lines varies in different kinds of stanzas but it is uncommon for a stanza to have more than twelve lines. The pattern of a stanza is determined by the number of feet in each line and by its metrical or rhyming scheme.
By contrast, the stanza by Charlotte Mew is heterometric, meaning that the lines are of different lengths; in this case, of six, seven, eight and ten syllables. It is common, but not at all essential, for all the stanzas in a poem to follow the same pattern with regard to: 1  rhyme scheme. 2  number of lines. 3  the lengths of the lines in corresponding positions (for instance, first or last within the stanza)
Lee does not use regular meter or rhyme, and the first 2 stanzas of the poem are cinquains (5 lines), while the second 2 stanzas of the poem are sestains (6 lines). You can see the shift in imagery, however, between one stanza to the next.
What is a Stanza? A Stanza is a set amount of lines grouped by rhythmical pattern and meter. It usually has four or more lines and is can be referred to as a verse. List of stanza names according to number of lines: 2 lines = Couplet. 3 lines = Tercet. 4 lines = Quatrain. 5 lines = Cinquain. Other stanza names: Ballad stanza. Ottava rima. Stanzas are used in poetry for structure. The length and pattern of the stanza decides what type of poem it is. Why don't you write a poem and enter it into one of our poetry competitions. More poetry terms below.
The term stanza means âstopping placeâ in Italian. A stanza is a set of lines in a poem, set apart from other sets of lines by space. Each stanza comprises its own unit. The break/space between stanzas generally indicates a pause between thoughts, concepts or actions. In standard practice, most poems end a sentence at the end of stanza.
In a poem, do all of the stanzas have to have an equal amount of lines? For example, can one stanza have 5 lines, the next 3 lines and the next 4 lines? Or would they all have to the same number of lines?
Best Answer: Technically, the separate groups of lines in a poem are called stanzas only if they have the same number of lines, the same pattern of meter, and the same rhyme scheme. Otherwise, they're called strophes. (Look up stanza and strophe for more information.)
2-line stanzas. A 2-line stanza is called a couplet. aa is a rhymed couplet; xx an unrhymed couplet. The French call rhymed couplets rimes plates or rimes suivies. 3-line stanzas. A 3-line stanza of any kind is called a tercet. aaa is a triplet. axa is pretty common, occurring in forms such as the villanelle and terza rima (where in both cases there are also rhymes between stanzas). The haiku is a species of tercet, and so are some varieties of englyn (though not the one featured on this site).

Sociology is the study of human social relationships and institutions. Sociologyâs subject matter is diverse, ranging from crime to religion, from the family to the state, from the divisions of race and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture, and from social stability to radical change in whole societies.

Social behavior, a subset of human behavior, study the considerable influence of social interaction and culture. Additional influences include ethics, encircling, authority, rapport, hypnosis, persuasion and coercion.
Unifying the study of these diverse subjects of study is sociologyâs purpose of understanding how human action and consciousness both shape and are shaped by surrounding cultural and social structures.
Through its particular analytical perspective, social theories, and research methods, sociology is a discipline that expands our awareness and analysis of the human social relationships, cultures, and institutions that profoundly shape both our lives and human history.
Psychology is one of the behavioral sciences â a broad field that spans the social and natural sciences. Psychology attempts to understand the role human behavior plays in social dynamics while incorporating physiological and neurological processes into its conceptions of mental functioning.
Human behavior refers to the array of every physical action and observable emotion associated with individuals, as well as the human race as a whole. While specific traits of one's personality and temperament may be more consistent, other behaviors will change as one moves from birth through adulthood.
At the personal level, sociology investigates the social causes and consequences of such things as romantic love, racial and gender identity, family conflict, deviant behavior, aging, and religious faith.
Psychology is both an academic and applied discipline involving the scientific study of mental processes and behavior. Psychologists study such phenomena as perception, cognition, emotion, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including issues related to daily lifeâe.g.
Behavior in this general sense should not be mistaken with social behavior, which is a more advanced social action, specifically directed at other people. The acceptability of behavior depends heavily upon social norms and is regulated by various means of social control.
Search. Also known as an accessory tragus or a branchial cleft remnant, ear tags are usually located in front of the ear or on the cheek, and consist of skin and cartilage. Many tags have a narrow stalk (a pedunculated tag), and some pediatricians may tie a string around the tag to intentionally âstrangleâ it.
Recommendations from Others. The American Academy of Pediatrics endorses universal screening to assess for hearing loss in all newborns as outlined by the Joint Committee on Newborn Hearing, regardless of the presence or absence of preauricular skin lesions.
In a prospective study of 23 newborns with preauricular skin lesions, four (17 percent) had abnormal findings on brain-evoked response audiometry. 1 Another study of 178 newborns with isolated preauricular tags found that 23 (13 percent) had mild to moderate sensorineural hearing impairment.
Because most tags have cartilage within the stalk, it is preferable to make a small incision around the base of the tag, and transect the cartilage stalk a couple of millimeters below the surface of the skin to avoid a small cartilage bump.
An online textbook states that the presence of isolated preauricular skin lesions in newborns does not confer a significantly increased risk of renal anomalies, and that routine renal ultrasonography is unnecessary unless the patient has other major malformations or signs of multiple congenital anomalies.
Ear Tags. Also known as an accessory tragus or a branchial cleft remnant, ear tags are usually located in front of the ear or on the cheek, and consist of skin and cartilage.
This will help you ensure that the area is clean. 3. Disinfect the area. Disinfect the area around the skin tag with 70% isopropyl alcohol or 10% povidone-iodine. Soak a cotton ball with at least 5 milliliters (a spoonful) of either substance, then swipe the tag itself and the area around it.
Skin tags are benign lumps of skin that often appear on older dogs of any breed. They can appear anywhere on a dogâs body but are often found on areas like the knees, the sides of the loin, the armpits, and the sides of the forelegs.
Part 1 of 2: Preparing to Remove a Skin Tag. 1. Identify the skin tag. Skin tags in dogs can be confused easily with warts, which are more dangerous because they can grow into malignant tumors. Unlike warts, though, skin tags have a narrow stalk that is attached loosely to the skin.
The skin tags themselves are harmless, but they can be unsightly and may get caught on something that could injure the dog and cause infection. Keep in mind that there is a slight risk of complications, and while you can attempt removal at home, the better option is to leave the skin tag alone or speak to your vet.
Well the rattling or clunk noise got louder and decided to look underneath. I saw one of the hangers that holds the muffler broken,so took it to the muffler shop. Well at the shop we discovered that there was two large holes were one hanger broke off and got lost and the other was just hanging by a thread. The the thing is that Saleen decided to weld the hangers from the muffler body were now it makes sence that it would break off sinner or later. So muffler shop patched up the holes and welded on new hanger from the pipe where it would be stronger. Well just giving you guys a heads up. Oh yeah the muffler that was most affected was drivers side.
Possible causes of a catalyst fracture are road debris striking the converter, loose or broken hangers, potholes or off-road driving. After You Install A New Catalytic Converter, if your car caused the OEM catalytic converter to fail, it could cause The New Converter To Fail as well. And the warranty that comes with a new replacement catalytic converter does not cover the type of damage listed above.
An oxygen sensor failure can lead to incorrect readings of exhaust gasses. The faulty sensor can cause a too rich or too lean condition. Too rich and the catalyst can meltdown. Too lean and the converter is unable to convert the hydrocarbons into safe elements and may not pass a state inspection. Road Damage or Broken Hangers.
Have your vehicle's exhaust system inspected periodically to keep your car safe. Loose, missing or damaged hangers or brackets can allow the exhaust system to shift around, causing a possible clunking or rubbing sound while driving. A loose exhaust system, when hot, can also melt wiring, nylon lines or rubber hoses.
Hangers, Clamps, & Brackets Exhaust System Description. Exhaust hangers can be made of synthetic rubber, or a combination of synthetic rubber and steel. Exhaust clamps are usually made of steel and come in different sizes to accommodate varying sizes of exhaust pipes and connections. Brackets are usually made of steel and mount to various locations.
CATALYTIC CONVERTER FAILURES: If a catalytic converter needs replacing, one of the problems below most likely contributed to its failure. Engine Tune-Up Required. A number of problems could occur to the catalytic converter as the result of an engine that is out of tune.
This leads to heat build-up and loss of power. Possible causes of a catalyst fracture are road debris striking the converter, loose or broken hangers, potholes or off-road driving. A catalytic converter will rarely fail without a problem or malfunction occurring somewhere in the emission system in front of the converter. It is important to determine what caused the converter to fail so that the problem can be fixed and to prevent a recurrence of the failure. Converter Meltdown. This is an example of a converter meltdown.

For me, I aim to keep a strict ratio of 5%net carbs, 65% fats, and 30% protein. I haven't had any issues maintaining this ratio, and its server as a great goal for me to plan my meals by. As far as how many carbs knock you out of ketosis, it varies by person.
Milk contains lactose, or milk sugar, and is not allowed, nor are cereals or starches. If you are consuming a 2000 kcal/day diet, your total intake of non-fibrous carbohydrates should not exceed 100 calories.
While you must limit your total carbohydrates when using a ketogenic diet, certain carbohydrates are allowed. Most of your carbohydrates should come from fibrous sources, such as vegetables, which do not count toward your total carbohydrate count. Limit your non-fibrous carbohydrates to no more than five percent of your total daily caloric intake. Certain exceptions to this rule do exist.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories. So, if you get 2,000 calories a day, between 900 and 1,300 calories should be from carbohydrates. That translates to between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day. You can find the carbohydrate content of packaged foods on the Nutrition Facts label. The Nutrition Facts label shows total carbohydrates, which includes starches, fiber, sugar alcohols, and naturally occurring and added sugars. It may also list total fiber, soluble fiber and sugar separately.
When eating less than 50 grams per day, your body will get into ketosis, supplying energy for the brain via so-called ketone bodies. This is likely to kill your appetite and cause you to lose weight automatically.
This is the reason high-carb diets can cause excess water retention. When you cut carbs, you reduce insulin and your kidneys start shedding excess water (14, 15). It is common for people to lose a lot of water weight in the first few days on a low-carb diet, up to 5-10 pounds. Weight loss will slow down after the first week, but this time the fat will be coming from your fat stores.
Simple sugars, many grains, lactose and fructose are all carbohydrates that must be avoided, fructose in particular. Fructose is primarily metabolized by your liver, and the longer your liver is burning sugar, the longer you will be out of ketosis.
This diet restricts your intake of carbohydrates like sugars and starches (breads, pasta, etc.) and replaces them with protein and fat. Studies show that low-carb diets reduce your appetite and make you eat fewer calories and lose weight pretty much effortlessly, as long as you manage to keep the carbs down (4).
I aim for as close to zero as possible, with no more than 75g in any one day. It's almost always way less than that. Also, a ketogenic diet isn't just low carb, it's also high-fat. If you can do at least 50% of calories from fat, that would help out any ketosis.
I do a lot of reading about low carb/kenogenic diets, and typically I see people are in ketosis and losing weight between 20-60 net grams of carbs a day. I began my low carb (not low enough for some people) with a goal of <100 net grams a day, and I've lost about 2 lbs a week.

ARV is to be injected in to the muscle in deltoid ( uppper outer part of arm) or lateral part of thigh. Giving intra-dermal needs smaller dose but is not a common practice in India. In India, we do not give it around naval. It should not be injected in gluteal region as fatty tissue there slows absorption.
Imovax Rabies; Rabavert; Descriptions. Rabies vaccine is an active immunizing agent used to prevent infection caused by the rabies virus. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the rabies virus. Rabies vaccine is used in two ways. Rabies vaccine is given to persons who have been exposed (e.g., by a bite, scratch, or lick) to an animal that is known, or thought, to have rabies. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis. Rabies vaccine may also be given ahead of time to persons who have a high risk of getting infected with rabies virus.
ARV is to be injected in to the muscle in deltoid ( uppper outer part of arm) or lateral part of thigh. Giving intra-dermal needs smaller dose but is not a common practice in India. In India, we do not give it around naval. It should not be inject...
No. The initial prophylaxis includes a single shot of rabies immune globulin, which may be given in the rear, or it may be given half around a particularly bad bite, with the other half in the rear; at the same time, the first dose of the HDCV immunization is given in the deltoid muscle of the arm, as are the subsequent doses.
The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) recommends that each type of feline vaccine be given to cats in a specific location on the body. For feline 3-way or 4-way combination vaccines that do NOT contain feline leukemia, the injection should be given on the outside portion of the right front leg below the elbow joint. For rabies vaccines (which are administered by your veterinarian) the injection should be given subcutaneously on the outside of the right rear leg below the knee. For feline leukemia vaccines, the injection should be given on the outside of the left rear leg, below the knee.
For Category III, in addition to this, Rabies Immunoglobulin(RIG) is given and this has to be given around the wound, i.e. where you have been bitten.
As of now rabies shots are no longer administered around the navel area. At present, the human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) for immediate protection is injected into and around the bite site. If the bite area is small, the remaining amount is injected into other body parts - deltoid (shoulder muscle), lateral thigh or in the buttock. Rabies vaccine are injected at deltoid in adults or older children. The lateral aspect of the thigh muscle is acceptable in younger children.
Rabies vaccination as part of post exposure prophylaxis is given for Category II and Category III cases. For Category II, only Anti Rabies Vaccine(ARV) is given and it can be given intramuscular on the fleshy part of your upper arm near the shoulder tip or, more commonly given intradermal(within the skin) on your inner forearms.
Nociceptive pain is the common discomfort experienced as a result of injury, such as a broken bone or appendicitis. Neuropathic pain is associated with injury to a nerve or the central nervous system. Such injuries can give rise to paresthesias, such as numbness, tingling, or electrical sensations.
The first step in treating peripheral neuropathy is to address any contributing causes such as infection, toxin exposure, medication-related toxicity, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, or compression that can lead to neuropathy.
Exposure to toxins may damage nerves and cause peripheral neuropathy. 1  Medication toxicity can be caused by many agents in addition to those for fighting cancer. Other agents that commonly cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect include those used to fight infection such as antiretroviral agents for treating HIV.
Cold feet. Nerve damage that makes your feet numb or unable to feel sensations, and can reduce your ability to feel your feet, or pain, heat, and cold. Foot injury is much more likely if you suffer from neuropathy. Possible changes in the shape or structure of your foot. Foot Ulcers on the foot, and toes.
Metabolic and endocrine disorders impair the bodyâs ability to transform nutrients into energy and process waste products, and this can lead to nerve damage. Diabetes mellitus, characterized by chronically high blood glucose levels, is a leading cause of peripheral neuropathy in the United States.
They also self-reported current smoking status. The percentage of participants confirmed as having neuropathic pain by clinical assessment who also smoked was 21%, compared with 13% in the overall sample (P = .009). Smoking was twice as common (62% vs 33%) in subjects who were diagnosed by clinical assessment as having neuropathic pain as nociceptive pain.
But can aggravate symptoms. It can also cause vasoconstriction which, if you have peripheral arterial disease, it can cause neuropathy to set in earlier. However, smoking does not directly cause neuropathy normally. Ask your physician if you are having neuropathy as there are many causes of neuropathy and it needs to be evaluated.

Cultivation facilities will be required to pay a 15 percent excise tax on the wholesale sale of recreational marijuana. Retail purchases of retail marijuana will be subject to state and local sales tax. Retailers will collect sales tax from consumers and remit it to the state.
Medical Marijuana Tax. Medical Marijuana Tax Return. An excise tax on the wholesale and retail sale of Medical Use Marijuana and Marijuana Products. The rate is 2% of the sales price every time it is sold regardless if sold for wholesale or retail. The tax return is due monthly and is imposed on the person making the sale.
Marijuana Taxes: What You Can Expect to Pay at a Dispensary. Four states and Washington, DC have legalized recreational marijuana. In Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, sales have already been underway for over two years now. Alaska issued its first retail license in early September, with sales expected to start in October.
Learn about Nevadaâs marijuana laws. Nevada is one of the 20 states that have decriminalized personal use marijuana possession. Four of those states, Washington, Colorado, Alaska, and Oregon, have adopted laws that legalize, tax, and regulate marijuana for adults 21 and older.
State Sales Tax: All recreational marijuana purchases are taxed an additional 10% over the standard 2.9% states sales tax. Therefore, the state sales tax on recreational marijuana is 12.90%. City Taxes: Cities assign their own tax rates to recreation marijuana, so the rates will be a bit different everywhere.
Vote Yes On 2! Question 2 will benefit Nevada by regulating marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol: 1  It makes possession of small amounts of marijuana legal for adults 21 years of age or older; 2  It establishes strict rules for the cultivation, production, distribution, and sale of marijuana in Nevada; and.
On November 8, 2016, 55% of Nevada voters approved Question 2, which legalizes, taxes, and regulates marijuana for adults 21 and older. The Marijuana Policy Project played a leading role in the campaign, which faced well-financed opposition, including $3.5 million from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.
There can be: 1  Up to 80 stores in counties with a population of more than 700,000. 2  Up to 20 stores in counties with a population between 100,000 and 700,000. 3  Up to 4 stores in counties with a population between 55,000 and 100,000.  Up to 2 stores in counties with a population of fewer than 55,000.
Before, under the 25% scheme, businesses had to pay federal income tax on the state taxes due to wording requiring that it be reported as income. Now, with the 37% rate, businesses can treat it as a sales tax and avoid paying federal income taxes on it. Beginning in fiscal year 2016 and continuing through 2017, Washington will allocate $6 million of cannabis tax revenues to local government which have licensed marijuana businesses.
Excise Tax: The 15% excise tax is a tax on the transfer of marijuana from growers to retailers (the dispensaries). You will not see this tax itemized on your receipt, but it will be passed down to the consumer in the form of higher retail costs. Currently the average price of an ouce of medical marijuana is $200. So the excise tax on an ounce would be roughly $30 on a $200 ounce, making the price $230/ounce before sales taxes.
Modules today are typically 2, 4 and 8 GB. Third is how much total RAM is supported by the motherboard, or rather the chipset on the motherboard. The operating system isn't a limitation, you can perfectly well have 128 GB of RAM and then install a 32-bit operating system on the computer.
depending on the laptop. if 32bit or 64 bit os. to find out how much yours can hold go here and it will tell you how much it can hold. RAM Memory Upgrade: Dell, Mac, Apple, HP, Compaq. USB drives, SSD at Crucial.com. if your just browsing the specs should say how much each slot can hold.
If in Doubt, Add More RAM. If the RAM you have installed on your computer is less than what you need, donât fret â these days, a RAM upgrade can be quite inexpensive, and the component itself is relatively easy to install How To Upgrade A Laptop's RAM, Step By Step .
Certainly the more memory in a laptop the better but there are other concerns regarding memory. Laptops are generally more restricted in the amount of memory that can be installed in them. Sometimes access to that memory can also be a problem if you plan a future upgrade.
As you'd expect, installing the modules is no different than for any other RAM except damn, 16GB a piece! Proof: Even though Intel spec's the max RAM in its latest NUC as 16GB, you can indeed get to 32GB of RAM using Intelligent Memory's new 16GB modules. Once I put the modules in place, I also decided to hot-rod the NUC a little more by using Samsung's XP941 M.2 PCIe module in it.
One motherboard may have a limit of, for example 48 GB for Unbuffered RAM, and a limit of 128 GB for ECC Registered RAM. The limits on the amount of memory addressable may also depend on the CPU installed. Some motherboards can address more memory with a Xeon CPU than with a Core i-series.
Your Motherboard determines the maximum amount you can install (due to RAM slots available) and Your CPU and Operating System determine how much of that RAM can be utilized. A 32 Bit OS running a 64 bit processor can only utilize a max of 4 GB, regardless of the amount you have installed. a 64 Bit OS running with a 64 Bit processer can utilize 18 GB of RAM or more. This has to do with the way the OS is coded to utilize the pathways of the CPU.
But if you're not the average person and you're hitting a performance wall with today's 8GB RAM modules, you've been out of luck. Enter I'M Intelligent Memory, which claims its new 16GB modules will take your Broadwell U-based laptop or Mini NUC-style PC beyond what even Intel will approve.
The maximum amount of RAM that can be installed and utilised is the minimum of the following: 1  Maximum amount of memory supported by the memory controller for the Nehalem microarchitecture the memory controller is part of the CPU. Older systems usually had the memory controller on the motherboard.
The baseline for RAM in a computer is 4GB; thatâs how much you can expect from a budget model, and itâll just about do the job â just donât expect to be running high-intensity programs or to have several applications open at the same time without performance taking a hit.
Oysters naturally grow in estuarine bodies of brackish water. When farmed, the temperature and salinity of the water are controlled (or at least monitored), so as to induce spawning and fertilization, as well as to speed the rate of maturation â which can take several years.
The largest pearl-bearing oyster is the marine Pinctada maxima, which is roughly the size of a dinner plate. Not all individual oysters produce pearls naturally. In fact, in a harvest of two and a half tons of oysters, only three to four oysters produce what commercial buyers consider to be absolute perfect pearls. In nature, pearl oysters produce pearls by covering a minute invasive object with nacre.
Oysters fall into five species: Eastern, Pacific, Kumamoto, Olympia, and European Flat (or Belon). The many varieties within each species take their names from the body of water from which theyâre harvested: Wellfleet oysters from Wellfleet, Mass., Hama Hamas from Washingtonâs Hamma Hamma River and so on.
Known more accurately as âThe European Flat Oysterâ (only true âBelonsâ come from the Belon River estuary in Brittany, France) these large oysters were transplanted to Maine decades ago.
Harvesting oysters from the pier at Cancale, Brittany, France 2005. Oyster farming is an aquaculture (or mariculture) practice in which oysters are raised for human consumption. Oyster farming was practiced by the ancient Romans as early as the 1st century BC on the Italian peninsula and later in Britain for export to Rome.
Other sources state that a single oyster can filter 24â96 liters a day(1â4 liters per hour). With 750,000 oysters in one acre, 18,000,000-72,000,000 liters of water can be filtered, removing most forms of particulate matter suspended in the water column. The particulate matter oysters remove are sand, clay, silt, detritus, and phytoplankton.
Wild Maine Belon Oysters are an allowable catch in Maine from mid September until mid June â but are premium in October through March with colder water temperatures. Select âfarmsâ in Maine are authorized to harvest year-round, but are a true cottage industry with modest output. With so few harvested a year (estimated at no more than 5,000), the Maine âBelonâ is among the rarest oyster available anywhere. Availability is Seasonal and Limited. Two Dozen.
The wild oyster does exist but the reality is, almost all oysters are farmed. And thatâs okâbetter, actually. Oysters are filter feeders, pumping water through their bodies as they nibble on plankton and other bits of the sea. They need only seawater and the water needs them, so farming them makes sense. And besides, said Jacobsen, wild oysters donât taste as good as farmed.
Suspended plankton and particles are trapped in the mucus of a gill, and from there are transported to the mouth, where they are eaten, digested, and expelled as feces or pseudofeces. Oysters feed most actively at temperatures above 10 Â°C (50 Â°F). An oyster can filter up to 5 L (1.3 US gal) of water per hour.
That said, there is a time of year when they taste their very best, and that is late fall into winter. Their biology dictates it. Oysters eat algae, starting in the spring when the water starts to warm, and they stop chowing down, essentially going into hibernation, in winter when the water gets too cold.
Answer by Eva Takacs. Confidence votes 5.5K. John Locke, the English philosopher advanced the idea of natural rights in his work Two Treaties of Government denying the divine rights of kings. Later rousseau, French philosopher elaborated on the idea in his work called Social Contract.
Dignity is a key term for the discussion of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not justify its claims on any philosophical basis, but rather it simply appeals to human dignity. Karl Rahner discusses human dignity as it relates to freedom.
Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of Weber).
The use of atomic weapons at the end of World War 2 fostered fears about their potential use during the Cold War years.
An important factor leading to the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazi dictatorship that took Germany into World War 2 was.. The economic burden of war reperations (payments) to Germany's former enemies.
.that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of  these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish â¦  it, and to institute new Government, . . ..
The idea of human rights is not without its critics. Jeremy Bentham, Edmund Burke, Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Marx are examples of historical philosophers who criticised the notion of natural rights. Alasdair MacIntyre is a leading contemporary critic of human rights.
In the late 19th century, industrialization led to harsh working conditions in the U.S. Which policies of the U.S government allowed such conditions to develop and later led to the growth of labor unions to correct abuses of workers. laissez-faire policies toward big business.
Share to: When the government and it representatives no longer do the will of the prople, and depart from the Constitution so far as to become nearly unrecognizable.
The philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why the concept of human rights developed. One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds.
Prilosec (omeprazole) is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the treatment of conditions such as ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease , and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which are all caused by stomach acid. Prilosec is available in generic form. Side effects of Prilosec include: headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, gas,
Rarely, proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole) have caused vitamin B-12 deficiency. The risk is increased if they are taken every day for a long time (3 years or longer). Tell your doctor right away if you develop symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency (such as unusual weakness, sore tongue, or numbness/tingling of the hands/feet).
Prescription PPIs are approved to: 1  Treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a chronic digestive disorder that occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus. 2  Get rid of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a type of bacteria usually found in the stomach.
For Healthcare Professionals. Applies to omeprazole: compounding powder, oral delayed release capsule, oral delayed release tablet, oral powder for reconstitution, oral powder for reconstitution delayed release, oral suspension. The most commonly reported side effects included headache, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.
Common side effects of omeprazole include constipation, gas, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Omeprazole can cause dizziness, drowsiness, and blurred vision. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how omeprazole affects you.
Incidence not known. 1  Drowsiness. 2  fast, racing, or uneven heartbeat. 3  mood or mental changes. 4  muscle spasms (tetany) or twitching seizures. 5  nausea or vomiting. 6  trembling.
Omeprazole, sold under the brand names Prilosec and Losec among others, is a medication used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and ZollingerâEllison syndrome.[1] It is also used to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in people who are at high risk.[1] It can be taken by mouth or injected into a vein.[1][ ...
The dose your doctor recommends may be based on the following: 1  the condition being treated. 2  other medical conditions you have. 3  other medications you are taking. 4  how you respond to this medication. 5  your age. 6  your weight.
Do PPIs have long-term side effects? Published: January, 2009 Nexium and the other proton-pump inhibitors are great at reducing stomach acid, but that might have some unintended consequences. Madison Avenue has given stomach acid a bad name, but it's really kind of a bum rap. Dip into any physiology textbook, and you'll find that stomach acid serves several constructive purposes.
Omeprazole side effects. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to omeprazole: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

The Constitution was a compact â though Federalists and Anti-Federalists disagreed over whether the states or the people were the agents of the compact. In September of 1787, it was sent to the states for ratification.
Constitution of the United States of America (1787). Download PDF of the Constitution. The Constitution was written in the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by delegates from 12 states, in order to replace the Articles of Confederation with a new form of government.
Antecedent documents to the Constitution include the political writings about natural rights theory and forms of government by John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, and Montesquieu, and English charters of liberty including the Magna Carta and the English Bill of Rights.
During the ratification debate in Virginia, Madison promised that a bill of rights would be added after ratification. His promise reassured the convention and the Constitution was approved in that state by the narrowest margin. New York soon followed, but submitted proposed amendments.
The English Bill of Rights was used as a 'template' for the  American Bill of Rights by the framers of the US Constitution. The  main similarity between these two documents â¦ is the limiting of the  central power of in the governments, and protection from unjust  imprisonment.
William and Mary signed the English Bill of Rights, but Parliamentary members wrote it (there is no way to know which ones in particular).
Background. The English Bill of Rights is an act that the Parliament of England passed on December 16, 1689. The Bill creates separation of powers, limits the powers of the king and queen, enhances the democratic election and bolsters freedom of speech.
The Bill's protections can be compared in the U.S. Constitution to the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments in the Bill of Rights. The English Bill of Rights is an act that the Parliament of England passed on December 16, 1689.

Stay away from Sand. We donât recommend sand as a substrate for indoor Russian tortoises. It remains loose, sticks to food items and gets eaten, and it can be a major irritant to a tortoiseâs eyes. Some keepers use sand because the tortoises live on sand or dirt in the wild.But in the wild, the substrate is hard packed and weathered, not loose and sandy. Wild Russian tortoises also graze on low-growing vegetation; they donât eat directly off the substrate as they often do in captivity.ome keepers use sand because the tortoises live on sand or dirt in the wild.

You'll need to adjust your care and substrate choice based on your tortoise species, type of indoor setup, room humidity and temperature level, and your local area's temperature and humidity. There is no one best substrate that works for everyone.aution! Accidental substrate ingestion with food and (possible) following impaction is a danger with ALL loose substrates, but especially with sand because it's heavy and can collect in the intestinal tract. You should exercise care to keep your tortoise's food substrate free regardless of what substrate you choose.
Substrate and Furnishings. As obligate burrowers, Russian tortoises should be provided with a fairly deep layer of appropriate bedding. Reptile (orchid) bark, shredded aspen, clean soil, and cypress mulch are all acceptable choices. The substrate used should be easy to clean, and suitable for digging.ubstrate and Furnishings.

Myofascial pain is associated with muscle tenderness that arises from trigger points, focal points of tenderness, a few millimeters in diameter, found at multiple sites in a muscle and the fascia of muscle tissue.
The AccuBall ( a dual , high density rubber ball for trigger point release ) and the AccuStrap ( high density trigger point release ball with added strap for leverage , mobility and flexibility programs ) join the current product line that offers the existing AccuPoint ( ergonomically designed to cradle the spine or to release painful knots ) and ...
Myofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers.
Trigger points form only in muscles. They form as a local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or muscle bundle. These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles.
The inside of the body is covered with soft tissue called fascia. This tissue covers evert structure including organs, muscles, nerves and blood vessels. The fascia that covers your muscles is call myofascia. When the myofascia is stressed from overuse or trauma it can tear and adhear together. These adhesions are called trigger points and can prevent the muscles from working well. Trigger points lead to an increase in muscle stiffness and tenderness and a decrease in range-of-motion. In additiona, the discomfort from trigger points can radiate from the adhesion. This is called referral pain and the most common pathways are shown in this image.
A. What you have read about tender and trigger points are true. A tender point hurts to the touch and causes some degree of pain in that area, while a trigger point may not necessarily be painful to the touch but causes a degree of pain to be felt in another area.
Called also silver cone. trigger point a spot on the body at which pressure or other stimulus gives rise to specific sensations or symptoms. triple point the temperature and pressure at which the solid, liquid, and gas phases of a substance are in equilibrium.

The term trigger point was coined in 1942 by Dr. Janet Travell to describe a clinical finding with the following characteristics: Pain related to a discrete, irritable point in skeletal muscle or fascia, not caused by acute local trauma, inflammation, degeneration, neoplasm or infection.
Patient discussion about trigger point. Q. what is the difference between tender points and trigger points. I read somewhere in the net that there are two points called tender and trigger points which are one of the symptoms of fibromyalgia.
After eggs are refrigerated, they need to stay that way. A cold egg left out at room temperature can sweat, facilitating the movement of bacteria into the egg and increasing the growth of bacteria. Refrigerated eggs should not be left out more than 2 hours.torage limits for table eggs in the United Kingdom were 3 wk at 8 Â°C (Kinderlerer 1994), while in Israel 3 mo for refrigerated eggs and 16 d at room temperature (Lublin and Sela 2008). In many countries, eggs are required to be stored at low temperatures to restrict microbial growth.
Dirty eggs may be stored in temperatures of up to 60 degrees F. After an egg is refrigerated egg, it must be kept at that temperature. A cold egg left out at room temperature can sweat, facilitating the growth of bacteria that could contaminate the egg, according to the United Egg Producers association.Refrigerated eggs should not be left out more than two hours..That's why the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention recommend that U.S. consumers keep eggs refrigerated at temperatures of 40 degrees F, in order to prevent illness from bacteria.efrigerated eggs should not be left out more than two hours..

To warm up just your egg whites or egg yolks, separate the eggs when cold and place the whites and yolks in small bowls. Place these bowls into slightly larger bowls full of warm water and allow them to sit for 5-10 minutes (or simply let them sit, covered, at room temperature for 30-60 minutes before using).Leftover egg whites or egg yolks can be stored for later use.lace these bowls into slightly larger bowls full of warm water and allow them to sit for 5-10 minutes (or simply let them sit, covered, at room temperature for 30-60 minutes before using). Leftover egg whites or egg yolks can be stored for later use.
The bottom line is shelf life. The shelf life for an unrefrigerated egg is 7 to 10 days and for refrigerated, it's 30 to 45 days. A good rule of thumb is one day at room temperature is equal to one week under refrigeration..Eggs purchased from grocery stores are typically already three weeks old, or older.f you're an American, you probably store eggs in the refrigerator â and wouldn't think of doing it any other way. Yet, the US is one of the only countries where chicken eggs are kept refrigerated. In much of Europe, for instance, eggs are often stored right on the counter, at room temperature.
If you forget to take your eggs out of the refrigerator, you can warm them up very quickly by placing them in a bowl full of warm water. Just 5 or 10 minutes in a bowl full of warm water â hot water may cause the egg shells to crack â will take the chill off of your eggs.Recipes that call for egg whites alone often call for them to be at room temperature. Eggs are, however, much easier to separate when they are cold.lace these bowls into slightly larger bowls full of warm water and allow them to sit for 5-10 minutes (or simply let them sit, covered, at room temperature for 30-60 minutes before using). Leftover egg whites or egg yolks can be stored for later use.
There's a global divide on the age-old question as to whether eggs should be stored in the fridge or kept at room temperature: Americans generally tend to store their eggs in the refrigerator to increase shelf life and to prevent bacterial contamination.There is no advantage in keeping the eggs refrigerated as opposed to storing them at ambient room temperature,â said Jay Tolley, the operations and quality manager at FoodTest.

Smelly, off, etc. That said, when local government wanted to regulate selling of eggs at farmer's mkts (that is, unrefrigerated) they offered the guideline of one hour at room temp ages an egg as much as one day in the refrigerator.

Japan claims Masako Hagiwara invented the first hand knitting machine for the home in 1924. It required that the yarn was laid across the needles by hand. Then we come to the first European domestic machine, a Passap, shown in Zurich, Switzerland in 1939 â we have come along way since then.
Answer Wiki. , Funnier than a soap opera. Nobody can answer this kind of question. Knitting, as well as crochet, weaving, etc., is a folk craft which got passed on orally for centuries. Some of these techniques have been invented indipendently in different areas, evolving from other kind of crafts maybe.
The skill is known as haken in Holland, haekling in Denmark, hekling in Norway and virkning in Sweden. Other forms of handwork - knitting, embroidery and weaving - can be dated far back in time, thanks to archeological finds, written sources and pictorial representations of various kinds.
The Hand- Cranked Knitter and Sock Machine by Richard Candee is the best resource book on the history of hand or treadle powered knitting machines invented in the United States and manufactured in North Amrica from 1813 to the 1990's. that I have seen.
The first dateable hunk of knitting found in Europe is from Spain (the Spain that was, at the time, held by Arabic peoples), in a tomb that was sealed up in 1275, slap in the middle of the darkest of the Dark Ages. And YET, all of the early knitting fragments have writing knit into them.
Research suggests that crochet probably developed most directly from Chinese needlework, a very ancient form of embroidery known in Turkey, India, Persia and North Africa, which reached Europe in the 1700s and was referred to as tambouring, from the French tambour or drum.
Quick Answer. The earliest form of knitting, known as nalbinding, is believed to date back to roughly the third to fifth century of the Common Era. This single-needle knitting approach can be found in socks from this period of time. Continue Reading.
No one person is credited with the invention of knitting, but it is considered an innovation. It started out as nailbinding, which seems to be resulting in a fabric much like that with twisted stitches. See link below for an excellent article on the history of knitting. 20 people found this useful.
Image from A History of Hand Knitting by Richard Rutt, p 30. Fragment currently at Yale University. The oldest REAL knitting (formed on two sticks by pulling loops through loops) we've got is 'Coptic socks' from Egypt, dating to around the year 1000 CE.
At the end of the 18th century, tambour evolved into what the French called crochet in the air, when the background fabric was discarded and the stitch worked on its own. Crochet began turning up in Europe in the early 1800s and was given a tremendous boost by Mlle.

When choosing a baseball bat for your season, it is important to first consider any rules that your program might have for what baseball bats are allowed and which are prohibited. For example, some little league programs do not allow composite bats (that is the type of material the bat is made out of).
Drop refers to the length of the bat minus the weight of the bat. The higher the drop, usually the lighter the bat is. Again, some leagues and/or programs have a limit on how much the drop can be so always check your rule book. If youâre a power hitter, you may do well with a slightly heavier bat. If you play small ball and try to get base hits, a smaller bat will give you more control. How to Buy a T-Ball Bat. What You Need to Know About Youth Baseball Bats.

A baseball bat is a smooth wooden or metal club used in the sport of baseball to hit the ball after it is thrown by the pitcher. By regulation it may be no more than 2.75 inches (70 mm) in diameter at the thickest part and no more than 42 inches (1,100 mm) long.
Bat Length. Have your child grab a bat and hold it with the barrel on the ground. The handle should reach right about to his hip (but not to his waist). In the example above, my son is about 56 inches tall and close to 70 pounds. He is graduating from a 29 to 30 inch bat, which is consistent with the chart belowâ¦.
The Wright & Ditsons Lajoie baseball bat. This bat had a normal size barrel but had two knobs on the handle. The lowest knob was at the bottom of the handle and the other knob was roughly two inches above the lowest knob.
Another sizing method for Baseball and Softball. Another great means for determining bat size is what we'll call the wingspan method. Have your son or daughter stand up tall with their arms straight out (arms should be parallel to the ground as if they were trying to mimic an airplane).
Choosing Youth Baseball Bat Size. Todayâs youth baseball bats are way different than 30, 40 and 50 years ago. From the days when there was nothing but wood bats to the present day youth baseball bats that sell in the $200âs and $300 âs dollar range. Back in my day I could not imagine asking my dad if he could buy me a $300 bat.

What is the right size baseball bat for your child? So many parents are confused by this question, and end up buying the wrong size bat. Iâm sure youâve seen it. The most common example is a small youth player around 10 years old dragging around a 34-inch bat.
Of course, the length of the bat is only one half of the equation. You might find the right size bat for your child, but it may actually be too heavy for him. The ideal bat weight is actually a bit trickier, and we should approach it differently depending upon the age of your child.
Radon is a dangerous gas. It is colorless and odorless and is always being emitted from our planet-don't worry, it's not enough to harm you.
When radium decays, it produces Radon. As Radon breaks down, it produces more radioactive elements known as, Radon Daughters or decay products. Radon can also be found in hot springs or naturally occurring spring waters. However, its presence in Earth's atmosphere is considered only to be, 0.0000000000000000001 percent.
Radon's Glowing Side. Even though Radon is a gas, it does has a boiling point. This is achieved by heating this element to -79 degrees Fahrenheit (-61.7 degrees Celsius). However, when radon is chilled below its freezing point of -96 degrees Fahrenheit (-71 degrees Celsius) a wonderful reaction happens; it glows.
Radon and Health When radon decays, it too produces a decay chain, with its own daughters. During its decay, it releases a large atomic alpha particle and the atom is transmuted into polonium. An alpha particle is essentially an helium atom stripped of its electrons.
The ratio of the activity of the SLRDs to the activity of the radon gas is called the Equilibration Ratio (ER). Equilibrium usually occurs in about three to four hours. When an individual receives a dose of one WL in 170 hours (a miner's month), the exposure then becomes called a working level month or WLM.
When this is the case, the radon contractor usually refers to isolation and ventilation. The Building Official's Code Agency recommends 1 square foot (865 cm2) of passive vent per every 150 square feet (14 m2) of floor space with vents within 6 feet (1.8 m) of each corner.
The uncertainty for attempting to extrapolate the yearly radon concentration from a five to seven day sample is huge: about +/- 90% (at the 90% confidence level) 17. For this reason, a single CC reading (or indeed several) cannot be used to estimate the annual radon exposure in a house.
For these reasons, there is some concern as to the amount of radon present within homes. Radon seeps into houses as a result of the decay of radium, thorium or uranium ores underground and varies greatly from location to location. On average, the earth's atmosphere is 0.0000000000000000001% radon. When cooled to its solid state, radon glows yellow.
The glow becomes orange-red as the temperature is lowered. Radon's most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of about 3.8 days. It decays into polonium -218 through alpha decay. Small amounts of radon are sometimes used by hospitals to treat some forms of cancer. Radon fluoride (RnF) is the only confirmed compound of radon.
Typically, when we speak of radon, we are speaking of radon 222 which has an half life of 3.8 days. This means that if a volume of radon is sealed into a container and left on its own, half of the radon will decay into SLRDs and be gone in four days.

Homeowner Associations, HOAs, get hazard and liability insurance for certain areas of condominium projects. However, home owners must understand what HOA insurance covers and what it does not protect. Usually, HOA insurance covers common areas and, often, the exterior elements, such as roofs, of condo units. HOA insurance seldom protects interior components of units, such as walls, any household goods or personal property.
A condominium, usually shortened to condo, is a type of real estate divided into several units that are each separately owned, surrounded by common areas jointly owned. Residential condominiums are frequently constructed as apartment buildings, but there has been an increase in the number of detached condominiums, which look like single-family homes but in which the yards, building exteriors, and streets are jointly owned and jointly maintained by a community association. Unlike apartments, wh
Master insurance generally covers the exterior structures of all condo buildings as well as common areas such as pools, tennis courts or common rooms. In the event of a disaster, your condo complex's insurance will repair these areas, but will do nothing to restore your unit. You are responsible for replacing items such as wallpaper and carpeting.
HOA insurance typically protects home owners for liability or hazard losses in common areas, but not any personal injuries, negligence or hazard losses inside condominium units. Should the condo project, or building, suffer hazard losses, HOA insurance does not cover damage to the interior of condo units. HOA Master Policy Examination Home owners must examine their HOA master insurance policy before buying their personal coverage. Never assume that HOA insurance protects all issues outside of your unit and common areas. The HOA can purchase coverage that it believes sufficient, but not necessarily cover some important hazards.
HOA insurance does not cover the interior of condominium units. Home owners must get condo insurance that protects interior components, such as walls, floors and ceilings of their units, along with personal property.
The common areas, amenities and utilities are managed collectively by the owners through their association, such as a homeowner association. Scholars have traced the earliest known use of the condominium form of tenure to a document from first century Babylon.
July 5, 2009. One of the benefits of condominium living is that you can enjoy the financial benefits of owning your own home without the time or expense of home maintenance. However, the benefits of belonging to a condo association don't take away all responsibility if disaster strikes. Although your condo may be covered by master insurance, you should strongly consider purchasing your own condo insurance policy to make sure you are covered in all situations.
Part of your homeowner's association dues goes to pay for insurance on your condo complex. If the building burns down, or the roof blows away in a hurricane, you should be covered by your condo's master insurance policy.
Get a copy of your HOA master insurance policy and read it. If necessary, have your insurance adviser translate confusing language. Then purchase home owner insurance that covers perils that the HOA master policy does not.
The description of the condominium units and the common areas and any restrictions on their use is established in a document commonly called a Master Deed (also known as the Enabling Declaration, the Declaration of Conditions, or the Condominium Document). Among other things, this document provides for the creation of the HOA.
This free haiku syllable counter counts the syllables for each line in a Haiku (or other form of poem). It's the best Haiku Syllable Counter in the world. Login | Join PoetrySoup
Syllables. To write or analyze a syllable poem, you need a basic grasp of the way words are divided into syllables. In English, syllables must have a vowel sound. For example, the word water has two vowel sounds, which divide it into the syllables wa and ter.
Counting syllables. 1  a short vowel counts for one beat. 2  a long vowel for two beats, 3  a double consonant counts for one beat. 4  the nasal consonant n at the end of a syllable counts for a beat.
Haiku Syllable Counter. This free haiku syllable counter counts the syllables for each line in a Haiku (or other form of poem) entered with hard returns. It uses a combination of a U.S. English haiku syllable counter dictionary and a formula-based haiku syllable counting program.
Syllable poems, or syllabic verse, are distinct from accentual-syllabic poems and purely accentual poems. Whether you are writing syllable poems for a class, for fun, or determining whether to define a poem youâre reading as a syllable poem, a quick overview of syllabification and of poetic form will help.
Counting syllables. The haiku is a poetic form composed of three lines, containng 5, 7and 7 syllables. In Japanese... But in Japanese, it is time, perhaps equivalent to the musical beat, that is important, for a syllable can be be short or long. Thus a Japanese haiku is counted in terms of time or beats (onjii in Japanese), a standard beat being equivalent to a short vowel. For example, the word Tokyo seems to be composed of only two syllables, to and kyo, but each of them is long, and the word thus counts four beats - to-o-kyo-o .. a short vowel counts for one beat. a long vowel for two beats, a double consonant counts for one beat. the nasal consonant n at the end of a syllable counts for a beat. The reason why there are only 17 syllables lies in the duration of the utterance. A haiku is meant to be read aloud in a single breath.

A chemical formula is a concise list of the elements in a compound and the ratios of these elements. To better understand what a chemical formula means, we must consider how an ionic compound is constructed from its ions.
The formula PO43- means that this ion is composed of: one atom of phosphorus, four atoms of oxygen, and three extra electrons.
the molecules PO4-3 and NO3-3 both have double bonds. PO4-3 is a tetrahedral, that means all 4 oxygens are sharing a total of 5 electrons with the phosphorus, and P only needs 3 electrons!
Ask the instructor if you're not sure about the answer that you come up with to these questions. Yes, ask, ask ask! This Q&A stores the information much better in your memory, allowing you to recall it for the test. If you're not able to keep up with the instructor, prepare ahead of time so that you can.
the molecules PO4-3 and NO3-3 both have double bonds. PO4-3 is a tetrahedral, that means all 4 oxygens are sharing a total of 5 electrons with the phosphorus, and P only needs 3 electrons! How is this possible.
The anion after the second dissociation, HPO42â, is the hydrogen phosphate anion. The anion after the third dissociation, PO43â, is the phosphate or orthophosphate anion. For each of the dissociation reactions shown above, there is a separate acid dissociation constant, called K a1, K a2, and K a3 given at 25Â°C.
Most people and even chemists refer to orthophosphoric acid as phosphoric acid, which is the IUPAC name for this compound. The prefix ortho is used to distinguish the acid from other phosphoric acids, called polyphosphoric acids.
We do not use 1 as a subscript. If we look at the ionic compound consisting of lithium ions and bromide ions, we see that the lithium ion has a 1+ charge and the bromide ion has a 1â charge. Only one ion of each is needed to balance these charges. The formula for lithium bromide is LiBr.
The formula of a compound that contains Na plus and PO43- ions is  Na3Po4. Its compound name is sodium phosphate, which is a generic  name for a variety of salts.

A vessel approaching a blind bend in a river can sound one prolonged blast on the ships' whistle to alert any other vessels to its presence, if another vessel is nearby then they will respond with one prolonged blast on the ships' whistle.
One prolonged blast from the horn of a vessel serves as a warning to other ships that an unseen vessel is in the water.
Smaller vessels entering or exiting a marina may issue a prolonged blast to warn other vessels that a boat is moving through the area. Situations that require prolonged blasts should be dealt with cautiously and at low speeds.
Any vessels within earshot of the prolonged horn blast should reply with a prolonged blast of their own. A prolonged blast is four to six seconds long and is commonly used in situations of low visibility such as fog or blind corners on a river. Know More.
A prolonged blast could mean several different things, all being dependent on the situation. One prolonged blast could mean: â¦ Rule 34 (e) A vessel nearing a bend of a channel or fairway, where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall sound ONE PROLONGED BLAST.

Potassium is present on the Earthâs crust in the form of minerals. Main ores having ample amounts of potassium are orthoclase, granite, sylvite, carnallite. Potassium is represented as the symbol K. Its atomic number is 19, and it has an electronic configuration of 4s1.
1.Sodium is represented as Na while potassium is represented as K. 2.The atomic number of sodium is 11 while that of potassium is 19. 3.The density of sodium is greater than that of potassium. 4.Sodium burns in a Bunsen flame imparting a golden-yellow color while potassium burns with a pale, violet flame. 5.Both react with water producing hydrogen gas, but the reaction of potassium is much more violent as compared to that of sodium.
Potassium reacts with water producing hydrogen. Sodium also produces hydrogen when reacting with water but the reaction of potassium with water is much more violent. Because of their high reactivity, both Sodium and potassium are found in the form of their compounds only.
Sodium vs Potassium. Sodium and Potassium are naturally occurring alkaline metals that show many similarities in their behaviors. Both sodium and potassium ions are essential for all life forms. Both ions are highly reactive and easily dissolve in water which is why both are found more in seawater than on land.
Potassium chloride, which is shown as KCl, is an ionic solid. It is in the form of a white color, odorless crystal. Potassium is a group 1 metal; thus forms a +1 charged cation. Its electron configuration is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1. It can release one electron, which is in 4s sub orbital and produce a +1 cation.
There is no known interaction between Potassium Citrate and Potassium Iodide in our records. However, an interaction may still exist. Always consult your doctor before taking these medications together. Do not stop taking the medications without a physician's advice.
Difference Between Potassium Chloride and Potassium Gluconate. Potassium is one of the essential electrolytes in the body. It is important to maintain the correct pH and blood pressure. Also, it is important for effective signal transduction. Therefore, if potassium is lacking in the body, it should be taken from outside.
Quick Answer. Visually, potassium nitrate (KNO3) and potassium chloride (KCl) may be difficult to differentiate because they both appear as colorless or white crystals. However, the two compounds may be distinguished from each other by conducting chemical processes and laboratory tests to check the physical properties. Keep Learning.
I got 500g of potassium citrate for $18, 500g of magnesium glycinate for $33.50, 100g of potassium iodide for $32.00, and 500g of ascorbic acid for $21.25. Comparing these prices per....
So while we are advised by doctors to reduce our intake of sodium through diet, it is important to increase the intake of potassium to reach a balance between the two essential metals inside our bodies. In brief: Potassium vs Sodium. â¢ Sodium has an atomic number of 11 while potassium has an atomic number of 19.
You could date the rent agreement on today's date and use the stamp paper of current date. You just need a clause in the Agreement to say that it is effective from May 2015. Legally, this would be fine. From a tax perspective, please check with your tax consultant. Also, notary is not required for all rent agreements.
A contract should not be dated until all parties who need to execute the contract have done so. If a party has dated a contract prematurely then the date should be amended to a date no earlier than the date on which the last signatory actually signed.
Finally, sometimes you see Effective Date used in a contract to refer to some date in the past. For instance, the parties to a distribution agreement signed on March 31, 2007, might want sales from January 1, 2007, to be included for purposes of determining 2007 sales. It would be simpler and clearer to say as much instead of using the term Effective Date and defining it to mean January 1, 2007.
In simple words the agreement can have a clause which defines the term of such agreement which can start prior to date of execution. Please also note that you can use the agreement on a500 paper for purposes of HRA, but it may not be admissible as evidence in case Rs.500/- is deficant stamp duty.
Documents are most commonly executed as simple contracts. A contract is made binding on the date that both parties intend that it is to come into effect, which is typically evidenced by both parties signing the agreement. There is no requirement for the signature to be witnessed. Simple contracts have a statutory limitation period of six years.
Seems like there is a misunderstanding on the correct execution date. If you signed on one day and they executed it for the day before, then your agent and broker need to contact the banks agent and correct the date and challenge it. The date of an executed contract is when the last party signs the contract.
This means that a party to the contract must bring any claim for breach of that contract within 6 years of the breach taking place. Any later and the claim will be time-barred. Deeds are required by law in certain circumstances. For example, transfers of real estate and powers of attorney must be made by deed.
1. Oh no, it has not been signed as a deed. If a document has not been correctly executed as a deed, it may still take effect as a 'simple' contract provided that: the requirements for execution as a 'simple' contract have been met; there is no legal requirement for the contract to be made as a deed; and. the signatories to the document had the necessary authority to sign a 'simple' contract.
A fully executed contract date begins once both parties signed it. In your case, since you signed them first, the date begins when the seller/affixes his signature. However, the delivery of the ratified contract should also be considered. Consult your realtor and a lawyer.
When a contract is dated by having the parties date their signatures rather than by including a date in the introductory clause (something I discuss in this blog post), one sees Effective Date used to refer to the date when all the parties have signed:

Pain Management: Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) Pump. Pain Management: Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) Pump. Pain medicine works better when the pain first starts, before it gets too bad. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump lets you give yourself intravenous (IV) pain medicine when you need it. This gives you more control of your pain relief.
It is administered either by pre-setting of the PCA pump and allowing automatic administration, or by nurse administration in the recovery setting. Most commonly it is the latter. Bolus dose- this is the quantity of analgesia given to the patient at each self-administration demand.
The PCA pump and syringe will be connected to your IV. You may get the medicine in any of the following ways: You may have a PCA pump that will run only when you need pain relief. When you feel pain, you can push the button attached to the PCA pump. A small dose of pain medicine will be given through your IV. Your button may blink when you are able to get another dose from the pump. You may receive a small amount of pain medicine running through your IV all the time.

While such ideas have been central to philosophy from its inception, the philosophy of space and time was both an inspiration for and a central aspect of early analytic philosophy.
Listen to the melody 'cause my love's in there hiding. I love you in a place where there's no space or time. I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine. And when my life is over, remember when we were together. We were alone and I was singin' my song for you. Songwriters. LEON RUSSELL.

I've been writing and maintaining FORTRAN(77), Fortran 90/95 and Fortran 2003/2008 code for the past 15 years. The replacement for my analysis job didn't even learn a compiled language in school, just MATLAB.
PlankalkÃ¼l (Plan Calculus) Konrad Zuse begins work on PlankalkÃ¼l (Plan Calculus), the first algorithmic programming language, with the goal of creating the theoretical preconditions for the solution of general problems. Seven years earlier, Zuse had developed and built the worldÂ´s first binary digital computer, the Z1.
This document has been created based on my practical experience from more than 10 years of professional FORTRAN 77 (from now on referred to as F77) software development and maintenance, and about 4 years of similar C++ experience. With such a background, I found it natural to try to mix the two languages by calling FORTRAN from C++.
For my senior year, the school sprang for a FORTRAN compiler to run on the business office NCR computer. My job was to run the students punch-card decks through the computer during the business office lunch hour. Spent an interim month learning to use FORTRAN as a language usage analysis tool, under tutelage of a Classic Languages professor.
This document has been created based on my practical experience from more than 10 years of. professional FORTRAN 77 (from now on referred to as F77) software development and. maintenance, and about 4 years of similar C++ experience. With such a background, I found it. natural to try to mix the two languages by calling FORTRAN from C++. I was surprised to learn that there was no standard way of calling F77 code from C++.
Konrad Zuse. Konrad Zuse begins work on PlankalkÃ¼l (Plan Calculus), the first algorithmic programming language, with the goal of creating the theoretical preconditions for the solution of general problems. Seven years earlier, Zuse had developed and built the worldÂ´s first binary digital computer, the Z1.
FORTRAN has been one of the most popular computer languages used for science and engineering for almost 40 years (the first FORTRAN language versions emerged in the mid-1950's). Much of the software developed in this period is now irrelevant and forgotten, but a large portion remains in use. In addition, new software is still being written in FORTRAN, simply
The Fortran compiler, introduced in April 1957, was the first optimizing compiler, and it paved the way for many technical computing applications over the years. What Cobol did for business computing, Fortran did for scientific computing. Fortran may be approaching retirement age, but that doesn't mean it's about to stop working. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the first Fortran (then styled FORTRAN, for FORmula TRANslation) release. Even if you can't write a single line of it, you use Fortran every day: Operational weather forecast models are still largely written in Fortran, for example.

Main ideas of the pragmatic adaptation approach. The core concept of this approach is that there are aspects of the social world that aren't going to change anytime soon, and that it can just be practical to know a thing or two about handling them. Going against the grain may just cause too much of a hassle.
These include: 1  The extent of a studentâs repertoire of knowledge about social situations, social communication, and social strategies. 2  The studentâs ability to apply his social knowledge in various situations and the conditions under which he/she is both able or unable to perform.

The first definition of pragmatic adaptation was also put forward by Albrecht Neubert. To his opinion, pragmatic adaptation is the process of adaptation of a translated work âto the needs of the target language audienceâ (Neubert 1968: 34). Another definition is proposed by a Finnish scholar Inkeri Vehmas-Lehto (2002), who suggests that pragmatic adaptation is applied to modify those source text elements which,

Cell Type: mesenchymal cell. Cell Source: white adipose (fat) tissue. Cell Characteristics: Differentiated adipocytes are spherical in shape with differences in fat organelle (lipid droplet) size. Most space in the adipocyte is composed of fat organelles.Mature adipocytes often contain a single large lipid droplet.dipocytes store energy for the body in the form of triacylglycerol and play a critical role in lipid metabolism and energy regulation. Adipocytes have also been found to express a wide range of cytokines, chemokines, receptors, and cell adhesion molecules capable of inducing inflammation.

Adipocytes have also been found to express a wide range of cytokines, chemokines, receptors, and cell adhesion molecules capable of inducing inflammation.
Lipid droplets, also referred to as lipid bodies, oil bodies or adiposomes, are lipid-rich cellular organelles that regulate the storage and hydrolysis of neutral lipids and are found largely in the adipose tissue.n non-adipocytes, lipid droplets are known to play a role in protection from lipotoxicity by storage of fatty acids in the form of neutral triacylglycerol, which consists of three fatty acids bound to glycerol.
White fat cells or monovacuolar cells contain a large lipid droplet surrounded by a layer of cytoplasm. The nucleus is flattened and located on the periphery. A typical fat cell is 0.1mm in diameter with some being twice that size and others half that size.The fat stored is in a semi-liquid state, and is composed primarily of triglycerides and cholesteryl ester.rown fat cells or plurivacuolar cells are polygonal in shape. Unlike white fat cells, these cells have considerable cytoplasm, with lipid droplets scattered throughout. The nucleus is round, and, although eccentrically located, it is not in the periphery of the cell.
Organelles and Their Functions. The nucleus is arguably the most important organelle in the cell. It is the control center, telling all of the other organelles what to do and when to do it. The nucleus also contains all of the cell's genetic material, or its DNA.This material has all the instructions the cell needs for making proteins and many other important molecules.ysosomes also break down proteins, lipids and carbohydrates into more usable forms for the cell. Living things need energy in order to perform daily functions. The mighty mitochondria are the organelles that make energy by converting food into more usable forms for the cell.

Adipose Tissue. Adipose tissue is a lipid storing type of loose connective tissue. Also called fat tissue, adipose is composed primarily of adipose cells or adipocytes.dipocytes are derived from precursor cells that develop into one of three types of adipose tissue: white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, or beige adipose tissue. The majority of adipose tissue in the body is white.
Adipocytes contain droplets of stored fat (triglycerides) that can be used for energy. These cells swell or shrink depending on whether fat is being stored or used. Other types of cells that comprise adipose tissue include fibroblasts, white blood cells, nerves, and endothelial cells.dipocytes are derived from precursor cells that develop into one of three types of adipose tissue: white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, or beige adipose tissue. The majority of adipose tissue in the body is white.
White adipose tissue serves three functions: heat insulation, mechanical cushion, and most importantly, a source of energy. Subcutaneous adipose tissue, found directly below the skin, is an especially important heat insulator in the body, because it conducts heat only one third as readily as other tissues.hite adipose tissue serves three functions: heat insulation, mechanical cushion, and most importantly, a source of energy.

The Zone diet typically caps daily calories for women at 1,200 and 1,500 for men. Thatâs two-thirds to three-quarters of the amount generally recommended for healthy people. Youâll eat five times a day: three meals and two snacks. Each meal should contain 40 percent carbs, 30 percent protein, and 30 percent healthy fat. After one year, the Zone dieters had lost an average of 7 pounds, compared with 7.3 for the Ornish group, 6.6 for Weight Watchers, and 4.6 for Atkins, and fewer Zone (and Weight Watchers) dieters had dropped out (about 35 percent) than Atkins and Ornish dieters (about 50 percent).

Above all, papaya is a very delicious food that has been enjoyed lavishly by people as a part of cuisines and salads. Health Benefits of Papaya: 1. Skin & Papaya-It is great for the skin and can be used as a face pack to get its benefits. It helps to get rid of acne and skin infections as it helps to open clogged pores. The fermented flesh of papaya also called as papain helps to dissolve the dead cells, giving fresh and glowing skin as a result.
The seeds of papaya are believed to have a strong antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect on our digestive systems. Studies have shown an extract made from them is effective at killing E coli, Salmonella, Staph and other dangerous bacterial infections.
While most people throw them away, papaya seeds are not only edible, small amounts of them in your diet can be surprisingly good for you. Keep in mind though that chewing half a teaspoon of the seeds is not like eating papaya fruit.
Like green papaya, the seeds contain high levels of proteolytic enzymes like papain which can help rid your body of parasites. In the same way that papain breaks down undigested protein waste in your food, it may also break down parasites and their eggs.
Skin Benefits of Papaya Leaf Juice: Papaya fruit is great for your skin and is incorporated in several face packs and skin care products to give you a healthy and glowing skin. Apart from the fruit, papaya leaf juice is beneficial for the skin in the following ways. 9. Papaya leaf juice has a higher content of vitamins A and C in comparison to the fruit, which promote skin health. 10.
As stated earlier, papaya leaf juice has proven to be effective in curing dengue fever. It offers a host of other health benefits. Some of the health benefits of papaya leaf juice are as follows. 1. Dengue is a deadly disease caused by dengue virus transmitted by the Aedes mosquito.
Papaya seeds are often reported as an effective treatment for liver cirrhosis. One method is to grind up around five dried seeds in a pepper grinder, or crush up fresh ones in a mortar and pestle, and mix them with a tablespoon of fresh lime juice.
Cholesterol & Papaya-As it is a fruit that is rich in fiber it lowers blood cholesterol levels. It contains enzymes that help prevent oxidization of cholesterol, which in return helps to prevent heart-attacks.
Since the papaya leaf juice is quite bitter in taste, it can be combined with other fruit juices. You can prepare papaya leaf juice at home by following the given steps. 1  Take several medium sized papaya leaves which are washed and partly dried. 2  Cut them and place them in a sauce pan with around 2 liters of water.
Papaya Seeds as a Treatment for Liver Cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis is a disease, usually caused by excessive alcohol consumption over many years, wherein the liver shrinks and becomes hardened. In this state it is ineffective at removing toxins from the body, leading to a variety of serious health problems.
Don't have the specs for a Diablo, but the Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 Roadster has a 48 valve DOHC V-12 that has 632bhp and 487 lb ft torque. 0-60: 3.5 sec. 0-150: 16.1 sec. 1/4 mile: 11.8 sec.@126mph Top speed:205. Not too shabby if you have an extra $351,700 laying around for the base model.
You people are stupid and need to know cars a Lamborghini Diablo Can go 200mph stock between 1996 I think to 2001 Bugatti is not the fastest car..the hennessey venom is the fastest car in the world right now as of 2013 of last year it can go 270.49 mph.
Estimated Arrival and Price: Watch for the Aventador SV to be unveiled at the Geneva auto show in March before going on sale later in the year as a 2016 model. Prices are unknown, of course, but anything that Lamborghini calls âsuper fastâ is always super expensive. Donât be surprised if the SVâs price eclipses that of the $500,000 50th Anniversary Aventador by at least $100K. View Photos View Photos.
How fast is the 1968 Ford Mustang Shelby GT 390 fastback? The 1968 Ford Mustang Shelby GT 390 Fastback has a top speed of 130 miles per hour and accelerates from zero to 60 mph in 6.2 seconds. The car achieves this performance with its high-power engine and lightweight body.
MAR 2, 2015. Lamborghini revived the Superveloce name for its newly-improved Aventator, and it's a deserving wearer of the name. Feast your eyes, on the lighter, rawer, more powerful Aventador LP 750-4 Superveloce, the fastest production Lamborghini ever built. The naturally-aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine gets a 50-horse bump to 750 screaming horsepower and 690 lb-ft of torque, thanks in part to a freer-flowing exhaust and refined valve timing.
To go from 0 to 60 mph, it takes 3.1 seconds. In addition, the Ferrari F12 has a horsepower of 740 at 8,500 rpm and 508 pound-feet of torque at 6,000 rpm, making its quarter mile time 8.5 seconds. Similarly, the engine is comprised of an F1 transmission, which tosses power to the rear wheels.
All that power's got a lighter load to carry around: Thanks to ample use of carbon fiber and the grand supercar tradition of charging more money for less stuff, Lamborghini says it's trimmed 110 lbs from the Aventador. The car has a power-to-weight ratio of 4.48 pounds per horsepower.
According to TopSpeed, a 2013 Ferrari F12 Berlinetta can reach a top speed of 211 mph and maximum engine speed of 8,700 rpm. The rolling resistance is low in order to reach peak engine speeds rapidly.
The top speed of a standard Nissan Skyline GT-R with no modifications is about 155 mph. With racing modifications and motor additions, Nissan Skylines can reach upwards of 200 mph.
Specifically, Lambo says it'll do 0-62 in 2.8 seconds, on the way to a top speed of 217 mph. To keep things steady at those speeds, the SV wears an aggressive aero kit, including a boy-racer rear wing adjustable to provide up to 70 percent more downforce than the garden variety Aventador.

Province of Connaught (Connacht) Connacht (Irish: Connachta meaning land of the descendants of Conn, is the western province of Ireland, comprising of Counties Galway (Aran Islands, Inishbofin and Galway City), Leitrim, Mayo, Clare Island (Mayo), Roscommon, and Sligo. In Irish the province is usually CÃºige Chonnacht i.e. the province of Connacht. Its main urban centres are Galway in the south, and Sligo in the north. It has a population of 503,083, the smallest of the four Irish provinces.
County Roscommon. Roscommon (in Irish Ros ComÃ¡in) is the only totally landlocked county in the province of Connacht and rarely visited by tourists. Generally speaking it is quiet here â on 2,463 square kilometres of land only 64,065 people live (so says the 2011 census), this still is 23% more than in 1991.
1 Most of the county lies between the River Shannon and its major tributary, the River Suck. Athlone on the Shannon is the main point of entry to the county; north of it lies Lough (Lake) Ree and, farther upstream, Loughs Bofin and Boderg. 2  The area is greatly dependent on agriculture, though there is some light industry.

Recently, there have been some changes with the powertrain warranty coverage on new vehicles from General Motors and Fiat â Chrysler Automobiles. Both automakers have dropped their powertrain warranty coverage to five years/60,000 miles from 10 years/100,000 miles. Powertrain warranties only cover a limited selection of items on your car, specifically components that only have to do with providing the vehicle power and making it move. Only Kia, Hyundai and Mitsubishi offer 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranties following the changes by GM and FCA.
February 8, 2011 2:52:12 PM. I am trying to find info about the history of the Lifetime Warrany that was offered by Rolls-. Royce in the past. When I was in the AF 958-62), there were tales of that unusual offering. and now with the news of people having them for 77 and 82 years it makes me curious. about how well they backed this and what it cost them.
Iâm still not going to buy a Rolex! Now rolex offer 5 years warranty for all the collection and advise to service 10 years once. The words right out from the provider, ETA movements have the least amount of warranty, says it all. Pre-Sub C for me.
Replacement of these bushings is an all-day job that requires a special Rolls Royce spring compressor. These cars are heavy and they tend to beat the front end bushes to pieces quickly. It's not unusual to need several bushings in a car that's only covered 20,000 miles.
Rather it is a cost/risk based decision on how many items they expect to have to fix during the warranty period and at what cost versus total revenue. If Rolex could fix watches for nearly nothing, they could offer a 100 year warranty knowing that they would have to repair each watch a number of times.
Walser Limited Lifetime Powertrain Warranty. Available on all new car purchases and most used cars with less than 60,000 miles. Duration: Warranty is valid from vehicle sale date during the customer's lifetime or until the customer no longer owns the vehicle. Coverage: This is an inclusionary warranty which means only named components are covered. The warranty is limited to these listed parts.
Big news for those who have been considering the purchase of a new Rolex watch from an authorized retailer: Rolex has recently announced (and confirmed) that it will be offering a 5-year warranty to go with all watches sold, starting from July 1, 2015 from authorized dealers.
Reply. Yes, the Arabs did reject the 1947 Partition Plan. The Jews accepted it, even though it meant that Jerusalem would be an international city administered by the United Nations and the three little triangles assigned to the state would be indefensible in attack.
Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (October 2007). The New Jersey Plan (also widely known as the Small State Plan or the Paterson Plan) was a proposal for the structure of the United States Government presented by William Paterson at the Constitutional Convention on June 15, 1787.
The plan proposed the following: 1  The Articles of Confederation should be amended. 2  In addition to the existing powers under the Articles of Confederation, Congress gained authority to raise funds via tariffs and other measures, and to regulate interstate commerce and commerce with other nations.
Under the New Jersey Plan, the unicameral legislature with one vote per state was inherited from the Articles of Confederation. This position reflected the belief that the states were independent entities and, as they entered the United States of America freely and individually, remained so.
The case was converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding and a trustee, Roy V. Creasy, was appointed. Shumate himself encountered financial difficulties and filed a petition for bankruptcy in 1984. His case, too, was converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding, and petitioner John R. Patterson was appointed trustee. Creasy terminated and liquidated the Plan, providing full distributions to all participants except Shumate. Patterson then filed an adversary proceeding against Creasy in the Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Virginia to recover Shumate's interest in the Plan for the benefit of Shumate's bankruptcy estate.
Both sides had also rejected the Peel Commissionâs Partition Plan of 1937, which would have given most of the country except for a northern canton around Haifa, to the Arabs, but population transfers â forcible, such as between Greece and Turkey in 1922, were proposed.
Perhaps the most important of these was introduced by the Connecticut Compromise, which established a bicameral legislature with the U.S. House of Representatives apportioned by population, as desired by the Virginia Plan, and the Senate granted equal votes per state, as desired by the New Jersey Plan.
Respondent Joseph B. Shumate, Jr., was employed for over 30 years by Coleman Furniture Corporation, where he ultimately attained the position of president and chairman of the board of directors. Shumate and approximately 400 other employees were participants in the Coleman Furniture Corporation Pension Plan (Plan).
The District Court rejected Shumate's contention that his interest in the Plan should be excluded from his bankruptcy estate. The court held that Â§ 541(c)(2)'s reference to nonbankruptcy law embraced only state law, not federal law such as ERISA.
The 1947 UN Partition Plan for Palestine was accepted by the Zionist community leaders. However, the Arabs rejected this plan on the grounds that this decision violates the rights of Palestinian Arabs present in majority in the country; they were supported by the Arab League in their rejection.

rowlet ties with froakie as the smallest starter pokÃ©mon being 1 00 rowlet is the lightest starter pokÃ©mon to date rowlet is the only alola starter whose first learned move is a previously unseen move leafage among the three starter bird pokÃ©mon rowlet is the only one that can fly torchic is based on the chickens and piplup is based on the penguins so they can t fly
typical of these games each starter pokemon in sun and moon sports a specific type an earthly element that functions sort of like rock paper scissors but gets complicated when other elements are challenged
so it seems like based on the image order that rowlett will either be grass flying or grass ground that litten will be either fire ground or just fire and that popplio will be water fighting respectively but this isn t quite confirmed yet
3 months ago 1 i haven t looked through to see if anyone posted this but this kinda makes sense worries me http pokejungle net wp content uploads 2016 03 sun moon fakes3 jpg this leaked a while ago and it s obviously not the grass starter pokemon but could it be rowlett s middle evolution there are a lot of similarities just throwing this out there for discussion

Weather.gov > Peachtree City, GA > FAQ - What is the Meaning of PoP. Explaining Probability of Precipitation. Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service routinely include a PoP (probability of precipitation) statement, which is often expressed as the chance of rain or chance of precipitation. EXAMPLE
The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the expected amount of melted precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area.[1] A QPF will be created when precipitation amounts reaching a minimum threshold are expected during the forecast's valid period.
View weather map showing the next 48 hours of snow, precipitation, and ice accumulation in the US.
Using a 40% probability of rain as an example, it does not mean (1) that 40% of the area will be covered by precipitation at given time in the given forecast area or (2) that you will be seeing precipitation 40% of the time in the given forecast area for the given forecast time period. Let's look at an example of what the probability does mean.
Does a 20% chance for rain mean youâre LESS likely to get rained on than if there was an 80% chance for rain? Does it mean 20% of the area WILL DEFINITELY see rain? Does it mean that 20% of today (4 out of 24 hours) will get rain? Does a 20% chance mean LIGHT rain, while 80% means downpours or storms?

There's people today that you can talk to and they will believe that he actually did that, says WS Fluke Holland, Johnny's larger-than-life former drummer. Johnny Cash shot a man to watch him die. He was a mean dude, he chuckles then shakes his head. The only time he was in prison is when we played in them..
Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison. On Jan. 13, 1968, Johnny Cash, considered by many one of the 20th century's most influential musicians, performed two shows inside California's Folsom Prison. The performances and resulting album, At Folsom Prison, helped revitalize Cash's previously lagging career.
At Folsom Prison is a live album and 27th overall album by Johnny Cash, released on Columbia Records in May 1968. After his 1955 song Folsom Prison Blues, Cash had been interested in recording a performance at a prison.
Cash began performing concerts at prisons starting in the late 1950s. His first prison concert was on January 1, 1958, at San Quentin State Prison. These performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison (1968) and Johnny Cash at San Quentin (1969).
US country music star Johnny Cash was well-known for his activism on prisoners' rights - but what impact did he actually have on the prison system? On 26 July 1972, three grizzled-looking men dressed uneasily in suits gave evidence at a US Senate subcommittee on prison reform. Two of the men were former inmates of some of the toughest prisons in the US - the third was the country and western singer, Johnny Cash.
Johnny Cash first took interest in Folsom State Prison while serving in the United States Air Force Security Service. In 1953, his unit watched Crane Wilbur's film Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison. The film inspired Cash to write a song that reflected his perception of prison life.
On Jan. 13, 1968, Johnny Cash, considered by many one of the 20th century's most influential musicians, performed two shows inside California's Folsom Prison.

Cash was born on February 26, 1932, in Kingsland, Arkansas, one of seven children born to Ray Cash (May 13, 1897, Kingsland, Arkansas â December 23, 1985, Hendersonville, Tennessee) and Carrie Cloveree (nÃ©e Rivers; March 13, 1904, Rison, Arkansas â March 11, 1991, Hendersonville, Tennessee).
Contrary to what many have said Johnny Cash never spent a day in prison other than when he did his shows both at San Quentin and Folsom Prison in California. He did do some time in jail several times for everything from possession of drugs to disorderly conduct.
Johnny Cash wan never actually IN prison. He went to do a concert and that was it. He did go to jail for drugs but never prison. He never go to prison as a prisoner, but he did a lot of concerts in prisons, like those in Folsom prison and san Quentin. He was never in prison as an inmate.

A meniscus is a piece of cartilage found where two bones meet (joint space). Menisci (plural of meniscus) protect and cushion the joint surface and bone ends. In the knee, the crescent-shaped menisci are positioned between the ends of the upper (femur) and lower (tibia) leg bones.
It is formed by the lower part of the femur, the tibial plateau and the knee cap. It enables hinge and rotating movements as the connection between the upper and lower leg. This means that we can not only bend the lower leg backward but also rotate the lower leg and foot towards the upper leg.
The lateral collateral ligament of the knee is on the outside of the joint, as indicated here: The meniscus is a c-shaped cartilage pad between the two joints formed by the femur and tibia. The meniscus acts as a smooth surface for the joint to move on.

I really disagree that the gene is not whatâs âdominantâ or ârecessiveâ and I donât like that we teach genetics that way. The gene is precisely what is dominant and recessive! I see that Hank is trying to make a distinction between the âgeneâ as a piece of DNA and âalleleâ as a particular version of that piece of DNA. But the gene is everything, and a trait, or phenotype, is simply the result of the DNA and RNA and protein that comes from it.
Best Answer: This is a great question. What makes an allele recessive is nearly always that it has a loss of function mutation. This means that that allele either produces no protein product, or one so altered that it cannot perform its job.
Traits that only require one copy of the same gene to show up are called âdominantâ while traits that require two copies of the same gene are called ârecessive.â Real world example: Red-headedness is a trait that is linked to a gene for the production of a protein being a little bit busted.
My other point, of course, the one that started this whole thing, is this: Traits are most definitely the result of genes, and hopefully you now see that âdominantâ and ârecessiveâ and all those other terms really only make sense when you keep three letters in mind: D, N, and A
The presence of recessives explains why two dark haired parents can have a light haired child, because the gene for light hair is a recessive trait, and therefore would not manifest in parents who had a gene for dark hair.
A recessive trait is a trait caused by a recessive gene, which means that someone must inherit two copies of the gene for the trait to manifest. By contrast, a dominant trait only requires one copy of the gene. The concept of dominant and recessive traits in genetics was put forward by Gregor Mendel, a 19th century scientist who is often regarded as the father of genetics, thanks to his extensive work in the field.

It isnât the gene thatâs dominant or recessive, itâs the trait. In biology, we call traits âallelesâ. Things like âI have blue eyesâ or âmy blood cells do not function properlyâ are traits. Traits are caused by genes.

It is best known as a flavoring for food. But over the years, garlic has been used as a medicine to prevent or treat a wide range of diseases and conditions. The fresh clove or supplements made from the clove are used for medicine. Garlic is used for many conditions related to the heart and blood system.These conditions include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, heart attack, and âhardening of the arteriesâ (atherosclerosis).arlic has been used safely in research for up to 7 years. When taken by mouth, garlic can cause bad breath, a burning sensation in the mouth or stomach, heartburn, gas, nausea, vomiting, body odor, and diarrhea.

When purchasing garlic supplements, pay attention to manufacturers that claim their product is odorless.. Odorless garlic formulas are often aged, reducing the amount of allicin and potentially deeming the product ineffective for alternative medicine use.lthough the National Institutes of Health states that garlic supplementation is considered safe for consumption by most adults, herbal supplements are not subject to approval by the FDA. It is always a good idea to let your physician know what supplements you take on a regular basis.
Not a good indicator. The many health benefits of garlic are derived from Allicin, not alliin (pronounced Alâ-ee-in). Alliin is a precursor compound to Allicin. Allicin conversion depends on the amount and activity of the converting enzyme allinase and alliin.On its own, alliin is only of limited value.one of these products contain any Allicin. Dried garlic powder contains both the allinase and alliin (precursor to Allicin) but not Allicin (1).On an equivalent weight, dry garlic powder has a higher level of alliin (3x) than fresh garlic.
Garlic supplements are made from whole fresh garlic, dried, or freeze-dried garlic, garlic oil, and aged garlic extracts. Not all garlic contains the same amount of active ingredients. It is important to read the label carefully.arlic has been used as both food and medicine for thousands of years, dating back to when the Egyptian pyramids were built. In early 18th century France, gravediggers drank crushed garlic in wine believing it would protect them from the plague.
Talk to a natural-health professional about choosing a quality supplement for garlic or supplement, if you'd like to try one. How to Cook Garlic: The best way to enjoy garlic's health benefits is to eat it raw, or close to raw. A temperature above 140F destroys the allicin, McClusky said.ome say that taking garlic supplements can also help to prevent them and get rid of them more quickly. Allicin: Allicin is a sulphur compound similar to the one found in onions, and it could offer a host of health benefits.

Reading comprehension is the process of constructing meaning from text. The goal of all reading instruction is ultimately targeted at helping a reader comprehend text. Reading comprehension involves at least two people: the reader and the writer.
Remember to take notes on the concepts presented in all modules. You may very well see this material again on a Concept Quick Quiz!! Module 1.1 - Reading as a Complex Cognitive Process. Learning Objectives: When you finish Mod 1.1 you should be able to answer the following questions:
The Reading Process. 2. Introduction. Reading is one strand of literacy. The reading process is complex and multi-dimensional. Effective. teachers have an understanding of this complexity and are able to use a range of teaching. approaches that produce confident and independent readers.
Metacognition is knowing what we know and what we don't know.. Just as an executive's job is management of an organization, a thinker's job is management of thinking, a learner's job is management of learning. The basic metacognitive strategies are: Connecting new information to former knowledge.
The process of comprehension begins before we start to read and continues even after the reading[. is finished. Good readers use pre-reading strategies like previewing the text and use post-reading. strategies like summarizing in addition to the many strategies they use to make meaning during. reading[ itself.
Comprehension is affected by the reader's knowledge of the topic, knowledge of language structures, knowledge of text structures and genres, knowledge of cognitive and metacognitive strategies, their reasoning abilities, their motivation, and their level of engagement.
Reading is described in many ways by different people. Some describe it as a thinking (cognitive) process. Others say it is the reconstruction and interpretation of meanings behind printed symbols. Still others say it is the process of understanding written language. All these explanations of reading are accurate.
Fluent reading is an active process in which the reader calls on experience, language, and prior knowledge to anticipate and understand the author's written language. Thus, readers both bring meaning to print and take meaning from print. The nature of the reading process alters as students mature.
Reading comprehension is also affected by the quality of the reading material. Some writers are better writers than others, and some writers produce more complex reading material than others. The more inconsiderate the text, the more work will be required of a reader to comprehend the text.
While word identification is a process that results in a fairly exact outcome (i.e., a student either reads the word automobile or not) the process of comprehending text is not so exact. Different readers will interpret an author's message in different ways.

Medical Definition of CRYPTOMNESIA. : the appearance in consciousness of memory images which are not recognized as such but which appear as original creations.â crypÂ·tomÂ·neÂ·sic \-ËnÄ-zik, -sik\ adjective. the appearance in consciousness of memory images which are not recognized as such but which appear as original creations. â crypÂ·tomÂ·neÂ·sic \-ËnÄ-zik, -sik\ adjective.
Cryptomnesia is a psychological phenomenon in which a person mistakes a memory for a new, original idea. Psychiatrists and psychologists believe that most people experience cryptonmesia from time to time, but the extent of the phenomenon and how easily it can be controlled is somewhat controversial.is studies expanded from there to an exploration of how stored memories may influence so-called original thoughts years or even decades after initial exposure. Jungian psychology contends that cryptomnesia is a normal part of most memory processes.
Cryptomnesia is, literally, hidden memory. The term was coined by psychology professor Theodore ThÃ©odore (flournoy-1854) 1921 and is used to explain the origin of experiences that people believe to be original but which are actually based on memories of events'they ve. forgottenryptomnesia may also explain how the apparent plagiarism of such people as Helen Keller or George Harrison of the Beatles might actually be cases of hidden memory.
Teachers are constantly seeking to outfox would-be plagiarists. But there's a wrinkle: Plagiarism isn't always deliberate. Indeed, research has shown that inadvertent plagiarism--or cryptomnesia, as psychologists have termed the phenomenon--is a rather common memory glitch that pervades everyday cognitive functioning.he mechanisms that underlie cryptomnesia also have important implications for creativity, Marsh believes. Recently, he, Landau, Hicks and psychologist Thomas B. Ward, PhD, of Texas A&M University, have examined how unconscious learning affects the creative process.
Carl Gustav Jung treated the subject in his thesis On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena (1902) and in an article, Cryptomnesia (1905), suggested the phenomenon in Friedrich Nietzsche 's Thus Spoke Zarathustra.n some cases, the line between cryptomnesia and zeitgeist (compare the concept of multiple discovery in science) may be somewhat hazy. Readers of Lord Byron 's closet drama Manfred noted a strong resemblance to Goethe 's Faust.
This fusion of existing bits into new combinations is a largely unconscious process, and for all its miraculous machinery, one serious downside is that it often obliterates the traces of the original sources we unconsciously fold into our ânewâ ideas.nd if we do our job right, there will be many, many links to come.â.

Cryptomnesia usually happens in isolation, with respect to but a single memory. That the phenomenon exists is not as disputed as how often it is diagnosed and applied to situations that otherwise look a lot like plagiarism.is studies expanded from there to an exploration of how stored memories may influence so-called original thoughts years or even decades after initial exposure. Jungian psychology contends that cryptomnesia is a normal part of most memory processes.
Some of the most common experimental designs in the study of cryptomnesia involve solving word puzzles. One such study from Stanford University in 1993 monitored subjectsâ memory for solutions found to a word puzzle game when paired against a computer opponent.he misattribution of memory is therefore more likely to occur as the time between the encoding of an experience and the recall of the subsequent memory increases. It has also been noted that misattribution may be a product of adaptive features of memory, rather than a product of a flaw in the memory system.
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis affecting about 237 million (3.3%) of the population. Among those over 60 years old, about 10% of males and 18% of females are affected. It is the cause of about 2% of years lived with disability.
A number of classification systems are used for gradation of osteoarthritis: 1  WOMAC scale, taking into account pain, stiffness and functional limitation. 2  Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale for osteoarthritis of the knee. It uses only projectional radiography features.
Osteoarthritis is derived from the Greek word part osteo-, meaning of the bone, combined with arthritis: arthr-, meaning joint, and -itis, the meaning of which has come to be associated with inflammation.
In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, which is primarily an inflammatory condition, in osteoarthritis, the joints do not typically become hot or red. Treatment includes exercise, efforts to decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications.
Osteoarthritis is a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Initially, symptoms may occur only following exercise, but over time may become constant. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and when the back is affected weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are those near the ends of the fingers, at the base of the thumb, ne

It's not that your Rx is causing a stink, but meds carry with them dry mouth as a side effect. Saliva is essential to washing odor-producing particles free, so when there's less of it, odor increases. It's essentially the same reason you get morning breath, according to the Mayo Clinic.

A bout of bronchitis or even a cold might be the cause of that stench. According to a 2006 report, respiratory tract infections cause bad breath thanks to nasal or sinus secretions passing into the throat and mouth. Bronchitis, pneumonia, sinus infections and postnasal drip can all lead to bad breath, WebMD reports.
Garlic, onion, asparagus, and curry are few of the more odoriferous foods known to affect body odor. Medications/ Supplements - Medications such as antibiotics can affect the bacterial balance of your vagina leading to changes in odor and discharge.
Calling all Steel Magnolias fans! The fruity smell of ketones on a person's breath is a well-known hallmark of severe blood sugar problems, usually in the form of diabetes although hypoglycemia can also cause it. While fruity may sound pleasant in theory, in reality the smell can be quite off-putting. And dangerous.
Lots of medications, both over-the-counter and prescription, have side effects that can cause body odor. For example, some birth control pills cause dry mouth, which can lead to a buildup of sulphur in your mouth. Sulphur, if you recall, is famous for its rotten egg smell.
A 2007 study found that obese people were more likely to have bad breath, but a 2013 study took that link a step further. It turns out that organisms that live in the gut of obese people may give off a certain, distinctive gas, causing bad breath in the mouths of the overweight.
Why does the vagina smell? The vagina is a carefully balanced ecosystem of fluid (discharge) and bacteria meant to keep the vaginal PH at a healthy 4.5. This combination of fluid and bacteria that make up the vaginal discharge that can, at times, emit certain odors.
6 Sneaky Reasons Your Breath Stinks. Some of the most common causes of bad breath are the most obvious ones. You know it's time to brush when you've had some particularly garlicky shrimp scampi or you practically breathe fire first thing in the morning.
Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) â The vagina is normally colonized with healthy bacteria, but if something disturbs the ecosystem, then unhealthy bacteria like BV can take over. BV is most commonly caused by an overgrowth of the bacteria Gardnerella vaginalis.
in Student Loans. After some changes to federal laws in 1998 and 2005, the statute of limitation on student loans has been dissolved (with some very limited exceptions), which means that you can no longer have your student loans discharged when you file for bankruptcy.
Every state has a statute of limitations (SOL) that limits how long a creditor or debt collector can successfully collect a debt. Typically, the statute of limitations starts when you miss your first payment with the original creditor. It does not start when the account was placed for collection. If a debt collector tried to sue you after this time period has expired, you can raise the SOL as a defense against the lawsuit. Many consumers confuse the length of time that debts can appear on their credit reports with the debt collection statute of limitations.
However, you will need to make a solid case and provide supporting documents to have your application reviewed and your loans discharged. Since there is no statute of limitation for a student loan, youâll have to find other ways to come up with a student loan resolution.
Your options will depend on your specific situation, but in many cases, you can set up a new repayment program directly with the U.S. Department of Education so that you donât end up defaulting on your student loan.
To determine the statute of limitations on different kinds of debts under each state's law, check with a legal aid lawyer, another attorney, or your State Attorney General's Office. The statute of limitations for a debt is usually different from the reporting period for a debt on your credit report. In general, negative information stays on your credit report for seven years.
The statute of limitation is 5-7 years in Illinois, but I moved to Oklahoma and the statute there is 3-5 years. Now since the loan originated in Illinois, do I go by the statute in illinois, or since the crediting company is calling from Oklahoma, where I reside now, do I go by statute of limitations in Oklahoma.
Last Updated: March 9, 2015. The statute of limitations is a rule that sets a time limit within which a creditor may sue you for payment of a debt. The length of time that a creditor has to sue you on an unpaid debt varies from state to state. In some states, it's four years. In other states, it might be longer.
The statute of limitations for credit cards (usually regarded as open accounts) in your state is 6 years. The date at which you are safe from having a creditor sue you over this debt is: No Acceleration Clause: January 15, 2011 + 6 years = January 15, 2017. Acceleration Clause: July 15, 2011 + 6 years = July 15, 2017.
After that, your unpaid debts are considered time-barred.. According to the law, a debt collector cannot sue you for not paying a debt that's time-barred. This gets tricky for consumers because the statute of limitations varies from state to state and for different kinds of debts.
Some collectors may decline to answer, however. Another question to ask a collector if you think that a debt might be time-barred is what their records show as the date of your last payment. This is important because it helps determine when the statute of limitations clock starts ticking.

O2 Although O is the symbol for oxygen, it occurs naturally as a diatomic molecule and is therefore normally written O2.
Interesting facts. 1  It is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe after hydrogen and helium. 2  It is the most common component of the earth's crust at 49%. 3  It is one of the two major components of air. 4  It is produced by plants during photosynthesis. 5  It is necessary for animals to breathe.
On a periodic table it is O but it can also be 02 p.s. whoever is supervising this post isnt doing a good job because before i changed this answer it was very rude â¦, nasty and unhelpful Suma rongi

Measurement of lung volumes provides a tool for understanding normal function of the lungs as well as disease states. The breathing cycle is initiated by expansion of the chest. Contraction of the diaphragm causes it to flatten downward. If chest muscles are used, the ribs expand outward. The resulting increase in chest volume creates a negative pressure that draws air in through the nose and mouth. Normal exhalation is passive, resulting from ârecoilâ of the chest wall, diaphragm, and lung tissue. In normal breathing at rest, approximately one-tenth of the total lung capacity is used.
The exchange of oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide into the air allows the blood leaving the lungs to provide oxygen to the bodyâs cells, while depositing carbon dioxide waste into the air. Control of Breathing. Breathing is controlled by the brain and may be controlled both consciously and unconsciously.
There is also something very similar to this called lung capacity, which are the variety of combinations that lung volumes can take on. This has to do with the inhaling and exhaling of air into and out of the lungs. On average, a human being can retain 6.3 quarts (6 liters) of air in his lungs at any one time.
Lung volume is the percentage of air that lungs can hold at any given period of time. This differs from person to person. The physical differences that accompany lung volume are known as lung volumes.
Normal shallow breathing only moves a small fraction of the lungsâ total volume into and out of the body with each breath. This volume of air, known as tidal volume, usually measures only around 0.5 liters. Deep breathing can force more air into and out of the lungs than during shallow breathing.
The total air volume of the lungs is about 4 to 6 liters and varies with a personâs size, age, gender, and respiratory health. Lung volumes are measured clinically by a device known as a spirometer.
Air inside the alveoli contains a higher partial pressure of oxygen compared to the blood in the capillaries. Conversely, blood in the lungs' capillaries contains a higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide compared to the air in the alveoli.
Lung volume is the amount of air normally breathed into and out of the lungs. Not smoking can help someone have a larger lung volume. Smokers tend to have smaller lung volumes. Human beings can retain 6 liters of air in the lungs at a given time. Lung volume may be negatively affected by scoliosis. Oxygen bars may be located at places at high altitudes. Those living in high altitudes tend to have higher lung volumes.

If the inner surface of the lungs could be stretched out flat, they would occupy an area of around 80 to 100 square meters â about the size of half of a tennis court! The lungs also provide us with the air we need in order to speak, laugh at jokes, and sing.... Click to read more below.

Through the end of 2013 you can defray a bit of the cost with the federal tax credit for installing energy-efficient windows in your home. The credit is worth 10% of the cost, up to $200 (excluding installation) and applies to replacement windows or new ones installed in an addition.e generally charges $40 to $200 per window to install them. Windows painted shut long ago will open and you'll preserve the architectural or historical character of your home -- which some neighborhoods may require anyway.
1 This are called new construction windows, and can cost as much as 50-100 percent more than replacement windows, or $5,000-$40,000 for completely rebuilding all the windows in a home.dditional costs: 1  A window installer should remove the existing windows, install the new ones, cleanup and dispose of the old windows, and wash the new windows. 2  Estimates are usually based on united inches, which is equal to the sum of the length and width of each window; a 40x55-inch window is 95 united inches.
A new window can brighten up a room almost as much as a new paint job, not to mention save you hundreds of dollars per month in energy bills. So if you were on the fence about replacing your old window with a new one because you didn't know the first thing about window installation, jump off.The following instructions explain how to easily and effectively replace an old window with a new one.f you can, remove them without damaging them, as you'll reattach them once you've installed the new window. 1  If you happen to damage the inside stop pieces while removing them from the window, take a bit of wood filler and mold it onto the damaged part of the stop. 2  Once it's dried, sand it and the surrounding wood down.
Remove the Old Window Sashes. Since the replacement windows fit inside the existing window frame, you only have to remove the sashes, parting bead and inside stop from the existing window. To make the project easier and safer, install your new windows from inside your home.tep 1. To find the width, measure from the inside of the jamb on one side of the window to the inside of the jamb on the other side of the window. Measure at the bottom, middle and top of the window. Use the narrowest measurement for the width of your replacement window.

Step 3. Slide the outside sash to the bottom of the window. Remove and discard the parting beads. Remove the outside sash in the same manner as the inside sash. Don't remove the exterior stop from the window jambs. These stops will retain the replacement window when you install it.tep 1.

Creating Rectangles and Ellipses. The Illustrator Tools panel includes several tools for quickly creating simple geometric vector shapes. They are easy to use; you just click and drag on the Stage to create the shapes. The Rectangle tool creates rectangles with square or rounded corners. The Ellipse tool creates circular shapes such as ovals and circles.
In this lesson we are going to learn the principles of drawing a circle as a vector ellipse in a 1 point Perspective and 2 Point Perspective view, using Adobe Illustrator. For this tutorial it is important to use vector drawing software such as Adobe Illustrator or CorelDRAW. In this case, we will be using Illustrator's Free Transform tool to distort the shape and aspect ratio or ellipse ratio of the circle to make it appear to be in perspective.
We will start out by drawing a perfectly round circle with a 90 degree (1:1) width to height ratio Fig. 1, using Adobe Illustrator's 'Ellipse Tool' (L). Our circle is positioned inside a square box (blue line) with equal height and width, created using Illustrator's 'Rectangle Tool' (M).
16. This smaller box will identify the correct intersecting points that our ellipse must make contact with (Fig. 16). Keep in mind that the Ellipse Tool (L) in Adobe Illustrator is not capable of creating this type of ellipse.
The Selection tool (V) selects entire objects. See Select objects with the Selection tool. The Direct Selection tool (A) selects points or path segments within objects. See Select paths, segments, and anchor points. The Group Selection tool selects objects and groups within groups. See Select objects and groups with the Group Selection tool.
Draw ellipses. Select the Ellipse tool. Click and hold the rectangle tool to see and choose the ellipse tool. For more information on selecting tools see Select a tool. Do one of the following: Drag diagonally until the ellipse is the desired size.
Note: The point of the inner square shown in Fig 16 is to show how an isometric ellipse (using Illustrator's Ellipse Tool) will not meet the requirements of a true perspective ellipse. It is not the size of the inner square that matters, but the fact that all four of its corners are capable of touching the ellipse.
You create a symbol set using the Symbol Sprayer tool. You can then use the other symbolism tools to change the density, color, location, size, rotation, transparency, and style of the instances in the set. The Symbol Sprayer tool (Shift+S) places multiple symbol instances as a set on the artboard.
Draw straight lines with the Line Segment tool. Use the Line Segment tool when you want to draw one straight line segment at a time. For a video on using the Line Segment tool, see www.adobe.com/go/vid0036. Select the Line Segment tool. Do one of the following: Position the pointer where you want the line to begin, and drag to where you want the line to end. Click where you want the line to begin, and specify the length and angle of the line.
Illustrator: Canât find ellipse (circle) tool. In Photoshop, the ellipse (circle) tool can be found by right clicking the rectangle tool in the tool panel. Illustrator, as with many things in comparison to Photoshop, is slightly different. Simply left click and hold for the ellipse (circle) tool to appear.
âpredatory species of sharkâ More example sentences âNow a recent study suggests that one creature - with a bite that may rival that of most predatory mammals - may have been sorely misjudged.â
An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator residing at the top of a food chain upon which no other creatures prey.[n 1] Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels and serve as keystone species, vital to their ecosystems. One study of marine food webs defined apex predators as those feeding at trophic levels above four. The apex predator concept is commonly applied in wildlife managemen
The Yautja, known colloquially as the Predators or Hunters, are an extraterrestrial species characterized by their hunting of other dangerous species for sport and honor, including humans. They were also referred to once as Xenopredators.
predation - the act of preying by a predator who kills and eats the prey hunting, hunt - the work of finding and killing or capturing animals for food or pelts Translations
Predation - By function. 1  Predators can be classified by their consumer-resource interactions [2] with their prey. 2  A true predator is one that kills and eats another living thing. 3  Grazing organisms generally do not kill their prey. 4  Parasites can at times be difficult to distinguish from grazers.
Opposite of predator, you have prey â the animals predators hunt and eat. Prey animals can be anything from the smallest insect to a 1400 pound bull moose. Some prey animals are herbivores, meaning they eat plants. Other prey species are omnivores, which means they will eat plants or animals. Most times, the word predator brings to mind an image of snarling teeth and slashing claws. While many predators fit this image, many others do not. Predators come in many sizes and shapes.
Define predator: one that preys, destroys, or devours; an animal that lives by predation â predator in a sentence one that preys, destroys, or devours; an animal that lives by predationâ¦ See the full definition
The predatory brown tree snake was introduced to Guam in cargo from the Admiralty Islands. Predation by brown tree snakes eliminated ten of the eleven native bird species endemic to the forests of Guam. The Nile perch, a voracious predator, was introduced to Lake Victoria in Africa as a food fish.
Non-native species can be added to a community either by natural range extensions or because they are introduced as a result of human activity. Most non-native species have harmful ecological effects; these are referred to as invasive species. Virtually all ecosystems are at risk from the harmful effects of introduced invasive species (also see exotic species, marine invasive species, and aquatic invasive species).
Predator-prey relationships can be more complex than a simple one-to-one relationship, because a species that is the predator or the prey in one circumstance can be the opposite in a relationship with different species.

The word 'beans' is purposefully in single quote marks, since what gets roasted and ground to make coffee is not really a bean at all, it is a seed. In particular, it is the seed of a fruit that grows on trees that can easily reach twenty feet or more. Some wild varieties grow to over forty five feet or fifteen metres.
Here is a plant at about 2 years old, maybe a little less. Actually this photo is old and this same plant is about 4'6'' feet tall, and 9 years of age. Larry Manfredi's Coffee Tree. Here's a note from a customer who lives in a much better climate to grow coffee ... outdoors, and planted in the ground.
The green coffee we sell for home roasting is a processed (de-hulled) dried seed. For all the processing entails (from wet-milling, depulping, drying, stripping the parchment, and even polishing sometimes) the embryo that makes this a live seed is often intact.
To roast coffee beans, heat a stovetop popcorn popper. Add the beans, stir them for 5 to 7 minutes, pour the roasted beans into a metal colander, and stir once more. This 15-minute process requires coffee beans, a stove, a candy thermometer, a spoon, a popcorn popper and a metal colander.
As a matter of fact, those are coffee beans! Many people picture coffee as brown, dry beans that grow from the ground. Instead, coffee is a âcherryâ that grows from plants that range anywhere from 5-7 feet tall (but our Q Grader, Paul, has seen coffee plants up to 18 feet tall! Thatâs a whole lot of coffee!). Coffee plants almost resemble small Christmas trees.
Coffee beans grow between 30 degrees south of the Equator and 28 degrees north of the Equator, essentially between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Coffee is grown in significant quantities in Central America, Brazil, the Caribbean, West Africa, East Africa, Yemen, Madagascar, Indonesia, Vietnam and India. The coffee plant thrives in a variety of soils, from alluvial to volcanic.
Growing Coffee Beans - Where Coffee Beans Grow. For a tree grown in over seventy countries, from Indonesia to Brazil, it is curious how narrow a range of conditions is necessary for growing coffee beans and how relatively small the total output is.
Where Coffee Beans Grow. r = Coffee Robusta m = Coffee Robusta & Arabica a = Coffee Arabica. Loamy and good draining soil is needed and also of help is high humidity - an abundance of mist and cloud at the higher elevations, over 3000 ft (915m) for the good stuff.
Although you may not recognize one at first, there are a few important coffee plant characteristics to take note of: 1  Coffee plants almost resemble small Christmas trees.  They are generally covered with dark green, waxy leaves that grow in pairs. Some coffee plants can actually produce purple and yellow leaves.
Mostly ripe coffee cherry on the branch. The coffee cherry from under-ripe, to green, to very ripe (crimson) to overripe. To have great success growing your own coffee from seed, you need a whole, ripe coffee cherry or from parchment coffee, aka pergamino.
Natural causes of early menopause. Premature ovarian failure (POF). Also known as premature menopause, POF is diagnosed when a woman body's stops releasing eggs and ceases hormone production in the ovaries. It can be the result of many factors, from genetic predisposition to autoimmune disorders.
They actually have associated syndromes - post ablation tubal sterilization syndrome, post ablation syndrome, post tubal ligation syndrome, post hysterectomy syndrome. Early natural menopause or induced or surgical menopause increases your risk for a number of health related problems.
Menopause is a natural transition every woman will eventually experience. For most women, menopause typically occurs in their 40s or 50s. For some women, however, this change can occur much earlier. Because this transition happens much sooner than many anticipate, early menopause can be difficult.
2 doctors agreed: Many: Usually the most common cause at your age is due to genetics. Some other obvious reasons are due to radiation or chemotherapy for certain malignancies. At times auto immune abnormalities can deplete the ovarian supply. Also some genetic mosaicism can cause early menopause. ...Read more.
Study the different types of tubal ligation and discuss with your gynecologist which one is best for you. If you develop symptoms of perimenopause after a tubal ligation, have your estradiol, progesterone AND FSH levels checked on day 21 of your menstrual cycle. FSH, the blood test for menopause, is OFTEN normal.
Many women suffer post tubal ligation syndrome after having a tubal ligation. Below is a list of symptoms that are associated with post tubal ligation syndrome. Post tubal ligation syndrome is often the result of a rapid decline of estrogen/progesterone hormone levels caused by the blood supply being damaged to the ovaries during the TL surgery.
Many women donât understand that a tubal ligation may cause them to go through perimenopause prematurely. There are structures in the tubes, such as nerves and blood vessels feeding the ovaries, which can be damaged in the procedure. Damage to blood supply can affect the function of the ovaries.
You could also get a second opinion about the ablation Essure causing it, since the article does not mention either as a cause. You may also want to post this on the Menopause Community as well, to find more support. Best wishes, Byroney.
Can having your tubes tied cause early menopause? Has anyone ever heard of having your tubes tied causing early menopausal symptoms? Tubal ligation should not cause menopause in an of itself BUT, there is a temporary sydrome that comes along with tubal ligation that can create/cause menopausal symptoms. It is usually short lived and goes away on its own.
The only way to find out for sure if you have a hormonal imbalance or are menopausal is to be properly hormone tested. Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome (PTLS) aka PTS is linked with: Castrative Menopause. Severe Hormone Imbalance. Ovarian Isolation (Post Hysterectomy, Post Tubal Ligation)
Gold has been used to make ornamental objects and jewelry for thousands of years. Gold nuggets found in a stream are very easy to work and were probably one of the first metals used by humans. Today, most of the gold that is newly mined or recycled is used in the manufacture of jewelry. About 78% of the gold consumed each year is used in the manufacture of jewelry. Special properties of gold make it perfect for manufacturing jewelry. These include: very high luster; desirable yellow color; tarnish resistance; ability to be drawn into wires, hammered into sheets or cast into shapes.
Gold! This metal is selected for use because gold it is THE metal of highest esteem. It would make no sense to make a king's crown out of steel-even though steel is the strongest metal. Gold is chosen for use in a king's crown because it is the metal associated with highest esteem and status.
And gold has been used to treat arthritis continuously since 1927. Europeans have long been aware of the benefits of gold in the system and have been buying gold-coated pills and 'Gold Water' over the counter for well over 100 years.
On Earth, gold is found in ores in rock formed from the Precambrian time onward. It most often occurs as a native metal, typically in a metal solid solution with silver (i.e. as a gold silver alloy). Such alloys usually have a silver content of 8â10%. Electrum is elemental gold with more than 20% silver.
Silver is one of the most famous precious metal s, and has been used for ornamental purposes since the earliest of times. Most silver is extracted from silver ore s, but considerable amounts are mined from Native Silver. Silver can be found pure, but is usually mixed with small amounts of gold, arsenic, and antimony. A natural alloy of gold and silver is known as Electrum, and is usually classified as a variety of Gold. Silver is a very resistant mineral. It does not dissolve in most solvent s, and won't react to oxygen or water. However, it has a detrimental reaction to sulfur and sulfides, which causes it to tarnish on exposed surfaces.
The Alchemists of Alexandria developed an elixir made of liquid gold. They believed that gold was a mystical metal that represented the perfection of matter, and that its presence in the body would enliven, rejuvenate, and cure a multitude of diseases as well as restore youth and perfect health. As many as 4,500 years ago, the Egyptians used gold in dentistry. Remarkable examples of its early use have been found by modern archaeologists. Still in favor today as an ideal material for dental work, approximately 13 tons of gold are used each year for crowns, bridges, inlays and dentures.
Alloying gold with other metals changes the color of the finished products (see illustration at right). An alloy of 75% gold, 16% silver and 9% copper yields yellow gold. White gold is an alloy of 75% gold, 4% silver, 4% copper and 17% palladium.
Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions. The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits.
In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy within and between nations, but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was finally abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1976.
The earliest records of the use of gold for medicinal and healing purposes come from Alexandria, Egypt. Over 5,000 years ago, the Egyptians ingested gold for mental, bodily and spiritual purification.

Mr. DOUGLASS states that in neither of these instances was any thing done by way of legal arrest or judicial investigation. The Baltimore American, of March 17, 1845, relates a similar case of atrocity, perpetrated with similar impunity--as follows:-- Shooting a Slave.
(All Douglass knew of his father was that he was white.) During this time he was exposed to the degradations of slavery, witnessing firsthand brutal whippings and spending much time cold and hungry. When he was eight he was sent to Baltimore to live with a ship carpenter named Hugh Auld.
Frederick Douglass (1818-95) was a prominent American abolitionist, author and orator. Born a slave, Douglass escaped at age 20 and went on to become a world-renowned anti-slavery activist.
IN a very short time after I went to live at Baltimore, my old master's youngest son Richard died; and in about three years and six months after his death, my old master, Captain Anthony, died, leaving only his son, Andrew, and daughter, Lucretia, to share his estate.
Douglass welcomed the Civil War in 1861 as a moral crusade against slavery. During the war he labored as a propagandist of the Union cause and emancipation, a recruiter of black troops, and (on two occasions) an adviser to President Abraham Lincoln.
An abolitionist, writer and orator Frederick Douglass was the most important black American leader of the nineteenth century. Born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey on Marylandâs Eastern Shore, he was the son of a slave woman and, probably, her white master.
Upon his escape from slavery at age twenty, he adopted the name of the hero of Sir Walter Scottâs The Lady of the Lake. Douglass immortalized his years as a slave in Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845). This and two subsequent autobiographies, My Bondage and My Freedom (1855) and The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass (1881), mark his greatest contributions to American culture.
PREFACE. IN the month of August, 1841, I attended an antislavery convention in Nantucket, at which it was my happiness to become acquainted with FREDERICK DOUGLASS, the writer of the following Narrative.
Garrison, too, was impressed with Douglass, mentioning him in the Liberator. Several days later Douglass gave his speech at the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society's annual convention in Nantucket-- the speech described at the top of this page.
Frederick Douglass stood at the podium, trembling with nervousness. Before him sat abolitionists who had travelled to the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. Only 23 years old at the time, Douglass overcame his nervousness and gave a stirring, eloquent speech about his life as a slave. Douglass would continue to give speeches for the rest of his life and would become a leading spokesperson for the abolition of slavery and for racial equality. The son of a slave woman and an unknown white man, Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was born in February of 1818 on Maryland's eastern shore.
Use the Molar Mass of a compound to convert it to grams, then convert that pounds. 1.0 lb = 453.59 g. 1.0 g = 0.00220 lb. Use the Molar Mass of a compound to convert it to grams, then convert that pounds.
The mass per mole of a substance is called its molar mass. Since the atomic mass unit (amu) is defined as 1/12 of the mass of the 12C atom, it follows that the molar mass of a substance, measured in grams per mole, is numerically equal to its mean atomic or molecular mass measured in amu.
MOLES TO GRAMS Multiply the number of moles by the molar mass of the substance. CONVERSION FACTOR Number of moles x Molar mass ////////////////////////// 1 mol GRAMS TO Mâ¦OLES Divide grams by the molar mass of the substance.
The answer is 0.00220462262185. Note that rounding errors may occur, so always check the results. Use this page to learn how to convert between lb mol and gram mole. Type in your own numbers in the form to convert the units! You can do the reverse unit conversion from gram mole to lb mol, or enter any two units below: I'm feeling lucky, show me some random units. ConvertUnits.com provides an online conversion calculator for all types of measurement units.
The mole is widely used in chemistry as a convenient way to express amounts of reactants and products of chemical reactions. For example, the chemical equation 2 H2 + O2 â 2 H2O implies that 2 mol of dihydrogen (H2) and 1 mol of dioxygen (O2) react to form 2 mol of water (H2O).
The mole is defined as the amount of substance that contains an equal number of elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012kg of the isotope carbon-12. This number is called Avogadro's number and has the value 6.02214179(30)Ã1023.
Pound mole, Amount of substance. For convenience in avoiding conversions, some American engineers adopted the pound-mole (noted lb-mol or lbmol), which is defined as the number of entities in 12 lb of 12C. One lb-mol is equal to 453.59237 mol. In the metric system, chemical engineers once used the kilogram-mole (noted kg-mol), which is defined as the number of entities in 12 kg of 12C, and often referred to the mole as the gram-mole (noted g-mol), when dealing with laboratory data.
Expresses the amount of a chemical substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 12 grams of pure carbon-12. A mole is the SI base unit for amount of substance or chemical amount.
Itâ¢s called a ï¬kilogram-mole,ï¬ and is the number of atoms in 12. kilograms of Carbon-12. So by definition, there would be 12 kg in one kmol of Carbon-12. You can probably predict what the lbmol is. Itâ¢s called a ï¬pound-mole,ï¬ and is the number of. atoms in 12 pounds (mass) of Carbon-12. So again, by definition, there are 12 lbm in one lbmol of. Carbon-12. Thus we can see that the values of the atomic or molecular masses are the same, whether the units. are g/mol, kg/kmol or lbm/lbmol.
The number of molecules per mole is known as Avogadro's constant, and is defined such that the mass of one mole of a substance, expressed in grams, is equal to the mean relative molecular mass of the substance.
If you are not able to have surgery to remove your cancer, you may have a tube put in to hold the bile duct open. This tube is called a stent. You don't usually need an operation to have a stent put in. A specialist doctor can put it in during an endoscopy or through the skin guided by X-ray.If you cannot have a stent, or it hasn't worked, you may have an operation to allow bile to drain by bypassing your blocked bile duct.To do this, your surgeon cuts the bile duct above the blockage and reconnects it to the small bowel.

If there is only a small amount of tumour growing over the stent, this can be treated by: â¢ injection of the tumour with alcohol or â¢ burning the tumour to open up the way through again, or â¢ inserting a second stent into the first stent, depending on the location of your cancer.re there any risks in having a stent fitted? Yes, there are possible risks with this procedure and the doctor fitting your stent will discuss these with you in more detail before you have this procedure. The risks include: perforation (making a hole in your oesophagus), bleeding and movement of the stent.

If your cancer is in the lower part of your stomach, you may have a partial gastrectomy to remove this. After the operation, your stomach will be smaller than it was before surgery. However, the operation will not affect the top part of your stomach, where your oesophagus (gullet) feeds into it.f you have surgery to remove the cancer in your stomach, you will probably need to have part or all of your stomach removed. Surgery to remove part of your stomach is known as a partial gastrectomy, and surgery to remove all of your stomach is known as a total gastrectomy.

3. Smoke the pork shoulder for about 1 hour per pound, or until the internal temperature of the thickest portion of the shoulder is 180 degrees F or so. If I want pulled pork, I will usually bring the temperature up to 190 degrees F or so. The meat pulls apart much easier when I do. (I never worry too much about time.
That could be porkâs new slogan after the United States Department of Agriculture on Tuesday said it was lowering its safe cooking temperature to 145 degrees, from the longtime standard of 160. The new recommendation is in line with what many cookbook authors and chefs have been saying for years.
The same temperature guidelines already apply to whole cuts of beef, lamb and veal. Other recommendations are unchanged. Ground pork, beef, lamb and veal should be cooked to 160 degrees, the agency said, and poultry should be cooked to 165 degrees.
âEveryone thought the sun revolved around the earth, too.â. The agency said that after pork hits the target internal temperature, it should be allowed to rest for three minutes, while its temperature rises a few more degrees.

Here is a recipe for the rub I use on pork shoulders. After you apply a layer of mustard to the pork shoulder, completely coat the shoulder with a good BBQ rub. I have found that it helps to pat the rub into the shoulder to make it stick better. Make sure you have some brown sugar in your rub to add flavor.

Mr. Pepin pÃ©pin said that the-145 degree recommendation was fine for leaner cuts like a pork, loin but that cuts with more fat would often be braised longer and reach higher. âTemperatures people are crazy about pork,â belly he. âSaid it has to be cooked for hours and. hours
You will also see the term big data when you encounter predictive analysis: in order to make predictive decisions, you need a LOT of data (customer, business, real-time, stored, etc.). Because predictive analysis is often used against big data, organizations purchase other software to help them extract and analyze the data.

If you've had a Google search finish your thoughts, you've seen predictive analysis in action. The crux of predictive analysis is the question:... for Teachers for Schools for Companies
Predictive analysis is the attempt to predict what could happen. To do this, we need to dig into data and pull out the pieces that can help answer that question. You may have heard of the term data mining to describe such analysis. But just mining the data, and bringing it to the surface, doesn't really DO anything.
Conducted a longitudinal-experimental study to describe the Cossack interactions of disruptive boys during the primary school years, and also verify the effects of both parent training and children's social skills training for the prevention of delinquency behavior; the study's population consisted of kindergarten boys from low socio-economic areas of Montreal; 1,034 subjects were retained for the longitudinal study; this total sample has been followed early from age 10 onward.

This study used structural equation modeling with longitudinal data from the Oregon Youth Study to test the hypothesis that the effect of socioeconomic status on delinquency in early adolescence would be mediated entirely by parental management skills.
Definition of Predictive Validity: In the context of pre-employment testing, predictive validity refers to how likely it is for test scores to predict future job performance. Predictive validity is one type of criterion validity, which is a way to validate a testâs correlation with concrete outcomes. The best way to directly establish predictive validity is to perform a long-term validity study by administering employment tests to job applicants and then seeing if those test scores are correlated with the future job performance of the hired employees.
Predictive analysis is about predicting the future: data mining information from data sets and analyzing it in order to find patterns and predict future events or trends. It is a forecasting tool. There are many examples of it being used today: In fact, the Oakland A's used it (long before it was cool) in the early 2000s to improve team performance.

My armpits have been giving off this musty/mildew smell for sometime now. I'm not sure where it is coming from, but its pretty embarrassing. Im currently using drysol and some deodorant in the morning to help with the smell.
Armpit Odor is the most common form of body odor. It is the unpleasant smell linked to stale perspiration under the arms. When the perspiration is exposed to the atmosphere, chemical changes happen. That is a sure sign that bacteria on the surface of the skin is processing the perspiration.
It comes from the bacteria in your skin. These bacteria eats the skin cells in your underarms and releases a chemical called 3-methyl 2-hexenoic acidÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬ which triggers the odor. Bacteria mixed with sweat, joined by the air equals a pungent and awful smell. The only solution is maintaining a proper hygiene. Poor hygiene can cause smelly underarms.
Ammonia and lactic acid, mainly present in eccrine sweat, in combination with the carboxylic acids resulting from microbial conversion (Signe Elisabeth Ãsberg) of sebaceous and apocrine gland secretions, seem to be the reason for bad smell in armpits. Human Glands and their properties. 1. Apocrine glands.
Use anti-antiperspirant lotions if you sweat excessively. These lotions contain aluminium chloride and should be used in the underarms, palms and soles at night. They work on reducing the amount of sweat. Deodorants do not prevent or control the amount you sweat, but they help to mask the body odour.

Maybe it's the deodorant I make, maybe it's my diet, maybe it's one of the many meds or supplements I take. Maybe it's the Great Kitten in the Sky making up for my early onset B.O. and big feet, but pit-stink just hasn't been a worry of mine for some time.
If this is your case then all you need to do is to control your diet and minimize your intake of these types of foods. Spicy Foods. Too much intake of spicy foods such as curry, onions, garlic, chillies and other spices can also cause your underarms to smell through your sweat.
Why Do My Armpits Suddenly Smell So Bad? Prepare yourself for a brief history of my armpits. When I was a little kid, few things were better than putting on my mom's deodorant. I loved slathering on my mom's liquid deodorant with the neato roller ball and powder fresh scent. I loved the way the liquid felt slimy and cold on my skin, and that I smelled like a grown up. At that point in my life, deodorant was an extension of playing dress up.
This same natural process becomes a nuisance aka body odour, when perspiration/sweat encounters bacteria on the skin. Dr Pai insists, sweat itself does not smell, but coupled with the dead skin cells, it provides a medium for the bacteria to grow. This bacteria, breaks down the sweat causing unpleasant body odour..
In the United States, some ticks carry pathogens that can cause human disease, including: 1  Anaplasmosis is transmitted to humans by tick bites primarily from the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in the northeastern and upper midwestern U.S. and the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) along the Pacific coast.
The three most common ticks in New York State are the deer (black-legged) tick, the American dog tick and the lone star tick. Only deer ticks can carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. They can also carry the germs that cause babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis.
The lone star is the most common human-biting tick in Florida and easily recognizable. Females have a light-colored dot on their back. Lone star ticks carry and transmit ehrlichiosis and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI).

Michiganâs Five Most Common Ticks Ticks are significant vectors (carriers) of pathogens that cause human and animal disease. In Michigan, tick-borne diseases are rare, but they do occur and can be serious if not properly diagnosed and treated.
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by the bite of an infected deer tick. Untreated, the disease can cause a number of health problems. Patients treated with antibiotics in the early stage of the infection usually recover rapidly and completely.
The black-legged tick (or deer tick) is mostly known as the carrier of Lyme disease. Black-legged ticks also carry babesiosis and HGA (human granulocytic anaplasmosis). Nymphs are found April through August. Adults are common throughout the winter (September through May).
Throughout the United States and Canada, there are a number of ticks that carry a number of serious diseases. And some ticks are known to carry more than one of these diseases, which can lead to multiple infections, or coinfection, that can complicate treatment and lead to greater health risks.

Only deer ticks can carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. They can also carry the germs that cause babesiosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Young deer ticks, called nymphs, are brown and the size of poppy seeds. Adult female deer ticks are red and black, while males are black.

So how is Facebook fuelling the comeback of such questionable business practices? Pyramid schemes have essentially been rebranded for the Internet age, under the guise of âmultilevel marketingâ schemes. But donât be fooled, the two have more than a few similarities.
Change the way you kiss. LipSense is the premier product of SeneGence and is unlike any conventional lipstick, stain or color. As the original long-lasting lip color, it is waterproof, does not kiss-off, smear-off, rub-off or budge-off! Create your own color palette by combining colors from over 50 shades. Member of DSA and DSWA.
Kristie educated me on the science behind the LipSense product, and the importance of applying the lip gloss after the color so my lips don't dry out and the color performs correctly. I learned that the product is waterproof, it doesn't smear off, and it can last from 4-18 hours (woah)!
The lip color is a lead and wax free liquid formulation that molecularly bonds to the skin and contains titanium dioxide which shields the sun, making it a great sunscreen/lipstick combination. I totally geek out on cosmetics, so I did some of my own research on both the LipSense ingredients and product wear. I have yet to see a lip color out there that compares to the long lasting (water & smudge proof) wear like LipSense.
In short, a legal multi-level marketing (MLM) firm must have a legitimate product, and derive real profits from that product. If a firm derives most revenue from recruits â using the new recruit money to pay older employees, for example â thatâs a pyramid scheme. Common sense goes a long way here.
Multilevel marketing schemes essentially skirt the law and âpyramidâ moniker by involving the sale of actual products, much of the time under a subscription model. They involve two levels of participation: the product, and the chance to become a partner who recruits more people to sell the product.
A pyramid scheme is characterized by an unsustainable growth model thatâs prone to collapse, and as a result theyâre illegal in most parts of the world. The core business practice relies on recruitment, with no sales of goods or services of any value taking place.
Naturally, firms that run pyramid schemes will often try to convince recruits that they are, in fact, a legal multi-level marketing company. And since the firmâs very existence depends on doing so, many sales pitches you hear will be very aggressive and persuasive.
eccolo74/iStock/Getty Images. Technically, there is a difference between a pyramid scheme and a MLM, although I'm using the names interchangeably in this article because there is A LOT of overlap between the two. Pyramid schemes, in theory, emphasize recruiting new sellers over actually selling product, but in the end, they do both.
But pyramid schemes are illegal in most states, while MLMs are not. And everyone, from the participants to the people who wrote the actual laws, is really confused about where the line is between the two. This results in a lot of lawsuits against supposedly on-the-level companies.

1 The Loose Sentence: Definition, Uses and Examples When you are writing in English, you have a choice as to how to construct your sentences. 2  One of these methods of construction is called the loose sentence.
In contemporary English, you now normally capitalize the names of the seasons only when they are personified. For personification, think of âpoeticâ or âcreativeâ uses, where the season is thought of as possessing the characteristics of a person, and so becomes a proper noun meriting a capital letter. 1  In March, Spring shows her joyous moods. 2  All Nature hides from Winterâs icy breath. 3  We will muse on Summerâs ploys:
Some people may confuse these words as being proper nouns and try to capitalize them using that rule of capitalization. 1  The winter season allows for many snow related sports. 2  My favorite flowers bloom in the spring. 3  This summerâs heat wave lasted over a month. 4  We often take long drives to look at autumn foliage.
Also, Midwinter and Midsummer are often capitalized, as they are specific days. Finally, the named seasons of a named year are also capitalized: 1  Back during Spring â09, we had snow all the way till May. 2  We arenât running the class for the Fall Semester.
Spring, summer, autumn, fall, and winter are common nouns like any other. Think of them as similar to morning, afternoon, and night âterms that denote clearly defined periods of time but are not capitalized because they are not proper nouns. As parts of official names, however, seasons are capitalizedâfor example, the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Fall 2011 semester.
Split and merge into it. Answer by Cookielee. Confidence votes 79. Capitalize the name of a season when it's the first word in a sentence, e.g., Spring signifies rebirth. or when it is part of a title, e.g., Spring 2009 semester, Winter Holiday Pageant, Glenn Oaks' Fall Festival, or  Mr. Winter..
Rule 2: Seasons as Titles. When a season is used in a title, the capitalization rule that applies to titles should be utilized. For example, in this sentence, âThe Fall 2014 Semester Ends in December,â Fall 2014 would be considered a title and therefore capitalized.
Most edited publications do not capitalize the seasons of the year, and we know of no major style guide that recommends doing so.

- An excerpt from âThe Sensitive Plantâ by Percy Bysshe Shelley. The capitalization of seasons has specific rules in the English language.

Seasons, such as winter, spring, summer and fall, do not require capitalization because they are generic nouns.
